- `NO-NO WORDS.csv` (Words and phrases to avoid in the draft)

---

## **STEP 0: Competitor Product Discovery**

Before writing, you must identify and locate the correct competitor products.

### Parse the Keyword

Extract the competitor brand names from the keyword:
- "life extension vs pure encapsulations multivitamin vs Seed DM-02" → Life Extension, Pure Encapsulations
- "metagenics vs pure encapsulations multivitamin vs Seed DM-02" → Metagenics, Pure Encapsulations

### Identify the Correct Product

For each competitor brand, determine which specific multivitamin product to compare:

**If the keyword includes a specific product name:**
- Use that exact product (e.g., "Life Extension Two-Per-Day" → use Two-Per-Day)

**If the keyword only mentions the brand name:**
- Search for "[Brand Name] most popular multivitamin" or "[Brand Name] flagship multivitamin"
- Identify their PRIMARY/FLAGSHIP multivitamin product in the general adult category

**Common flagship products by brand:**
- **Life Extension** → Two-Per-Day Multivitamin
- **Pure Encapsulations** → O.N.E. Multivitamin
- **Thorne** → Basic Nutrients 2/Day
- **Ritual** → Essential for Women/Men
- **Garden of Life** → Vitamin Code
- **Metagenics** → PhytoMulti
- **Centrum** → Centrum Adults or Centrum Silver
- **One A Day** → One A Day Complete

### Locate the Official Product Page

For each competitor product:
1. Search for the official manufacturer product page
2. The URL MUST be on the brand's own domain (e.g., lifeextension.com, pureencapsulations.com)
3. Do NOT use third-party retailers (Amazon, Vitacost, iHerb, etc.)

### Document Your Findings

Before proceeding, confirm:
- **Competitor A:** [Brand] - [Product Name] - [Official URL]
- **Competitor B:** [Brand] - [Product Name] - [Official URL]

---

## **STEP 1: Gather Seed's Scientific Evidence**

### Consult Internal Claims Documents

Review these files to find academic citations for Seed's claims:
- `DM-02 Product Messaging Reference Documents.md` - positioning and approved claims
- `DM-02-Key-Benefits-Claims.md` - substantiated benefit claims WITH academic sources
- `DM-02-General-Claims.md` - gut-nutrition claims WITH academic sources
- `DM-02 Gut-Nutrition Education.md` - microbiome-nutrition science
- Individual ingredient claims files: `DM-02-PQQ-Claims.md`, `DM-02-CoQ10-Claims.md`, etc.

**Extract DOI links from these files to cite in the article.**

### Key Studies to Reference

Pull specific studies for Seed's key differentiators:
- **Microbiome-nutrition connection** → Magnúsdóttir et al. (B-vitamin biosynthesis by gut microbes)
- **PQQ/Mitochondrial biogenesis** → Chowanadisai et al.
- **CoQ10/Cellular energy** → Barcelos et al.

### Develop Seed's Unique Narrative

1. **Identify Seed's unique scientific perspective** on multivitamins from the messaging documents:
   - **DM-02 angles**: Bioavailable forms, precision dosing, microbiome-nutrition connection, cellular energy support
   - **Cross-product themes**: Microbiome connection, evidence-based formulation, quality over mega-dosing

2. **Infuse Tone Early:** For each key differentiator, brainstorm ways to introduce Seed's perspective using a conversational or empathetic hook. *Example: 'We often forget that our gut microbes have their own nutritional needs—and the science is showing us just how much that matters...'*

---

## **STEP 2: Gather Competitor Product Information**

### Visit Official Product Pages

Using the URLs identified in Step 0, visit each official product page and extract:
- Exact vitamins and minerals included (and their forms if listed)
- Number of nutrients and % daily values
- Capsules/tablets per serving
- Delivery format (capsule, tablet, gummy)
- Benefit claims made by the competitor
- **Current price for a 30-day supply**
- Allergen and quality testing information
- Any unique features or technology claims

### Important Rules

- **Rewrite competitor information in Seed's own words** - do not quote or say "according to [competitor's] website"
- **Do NOT adopt competitor marketing claims as scientific fact**
- **Do NOT use competitor websites as sources for scientific claims** - only for product specs

---

## **STEP 3: Develop Article Outline**

Create a detailed outline following the MANDATORY ARTICLE STRUCTURE below.

### Outline Design Principles

- Structure MUST follow the `Tone Guide` recommendations
- Lead with comparison and user decision-making, not ingredient deep-dives
- Incorporate Seed's unique perspectives through contrast with competitors
- **Integrate Tonal Prompts into Outline:** For at least 2-3 key H2 or H3 sections (especially when explaining complex concepts or addressing sensitive reader concerns), explicitly note a tonal instruction within the outline itself:
  - `[Use Analogy Here]` - Think of a relatable comparison
  - `[Acknowledge Potential Reader Concern]` - Address decision fatigue empathetically
  - `[Explain Simply]` - Lead with plain language before technical terms
  - `[Transition with conversational phrase]` - Connect ideas smoothly

---

## **CITATION PROTOCOL (CRITICAL)**

This section explicitly separates WHERE to get different types of information:

### For Seed/Scientific Claims → Use Internal Claims Documents

Cite peer-reviewed academic papers from the internal `DM-02-[Ingredient]-Claims.md` files:
- **PQQ claims** → Cite Chowanadisai et al.
- **CoQ10 claims** → Cite Barcelos et al.
- **Gut-microbiome claims** → Cite Magnúsdóttir et al.

**DO NOT cite the Seed website (seed.com) for scientific claims.**

### For Competitor Product Specs → Use ONLY Official Manufacturer Pages

- Use ONLY the official manufacturer product page URLs
- Do NOT use third-party retailers (Amazon, Vitacost, iHerb, eBay, etc.)

### Final Citation List Structure

The Citations section should contain a MIX of:
1. **Academic papers** (with DOI links) - for Seed's scientific claims
2. **Official competitor URLs** (2 total) - for product specifications

**Target: 5-8 total citations** (3-6 academic + 2 competitor URLs)

### Inline Citation Format

For scientific claims: `([Author Year](DOI_URL))`

Example: "Research shows PQQ can stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis ([Chowanadisai 2010](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M109.030130))."

## **MANDATORY ARTICLE STRUCTURE**

You MUST use this EXACT structure. Do NOT substitute with ingredient-focused sections.

# [SEO-Optimized Title for Competitor A vs Competitor B vs Seed's DM-02™]

### Overview
(3-5 bullet points summarizing core differences across all three products)

[Introduction - 2-3 paragraphs acknowledging the challenge of choosing a multivitamin, setting up the comparison]

## What Makes a Multivitamin Actually Work?
[This section MUST cover these key concepts that set up the evaluation criteria:]

1. **Bioavailability** - How easily your body can absorb and use a nutrient. Many standard multivitamins use "inactive" forms because they're cheaper; your body has to convert these to "active" forms, which isn't efficient for everyone.

2. **Delivery** - Where nutrients end up matters. Not just about dissolving in your stomach.

3. **The Microbiome Paradigm Shift** (CRITICAL - this is Seed's differentiator): New science suggests nutrition isn't just about feeding your human cells—it's about feeding your microbiome too. Your gut bacteria actually produce certain B vitamins and vitamin K themselves, but they need the right "fuel" to do so. Cite Magnúsdóttir et al. here. A truly effective multivitamin considers this ecosystem.

## **SEED'S KEY DIFFERENTIATORS TO EMPHASIZE**

When writing the DM-02™ section, highlight these unique aspects:

### Microbiome Support
- DM-02™ supports both the body AND the microbiome
- The gut-nutrition connection is bidirectional
- Inner capsule delivers B vitamins and prebiotics (Japanese wasabi) to support gut bacteria
- **Cite:** Magnúsdóttir et al. on B-vitamin biosynthesis

### Bioavailable Forms
- Methylfolate (not folic acid)
- Methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin (B12)
- Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (B6)
- Cholecalciferol/D3 (not D2)
- Chelated minerals (e.g., manganese bisglycinate)
- **Key insight**: Bioavailable micronutrients don't just help YOUR body—research shows they also shape gut microbiome composition - **Cite:** Scarpellini 2021 (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19010037)

### Cellular Energy Complex (Unique to DM-02™)
- CoQ10 (declines with age, supports mitochondrial function) - **Cite:** Barcelos et al.
- PQQ (supports mitochondrial biogenesis) - **Cite:** Chowanadisai et al.
- Spermidine (cellular renewal)
- Vitamin K2 MK-7 (longer-lasting form)

### ViaCap® Technology

## **COMPETITOR ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK**

When writing competitor sections, evaluate:

### Formulation Quality
- Are vitamins in bioavailable/active forms or synthetic/inactive forms?
- Are minerals chelated or in oxide/carbonate forms (poorly absorbed)?

### Completeness
- How many vitamins and minerals are included?
- Notable gaps (no vitamin K, no trace minerals)?
- Any specialty compounds (CoQ10, etc.)?

### Delivery & Convenience
- How many pills/capsules per day?
- Tablet vs capsule vs gummy?
- Any special delivery technology?

### Microbiome Consideration
- Does the product address gut health?
- Any prebiotics or gut-supporting ingredients?

## **TONE & VOICE REQUIREMENTS**

### Core Persona

Before writing, *and continuously throughout the writing process*, actively embody the persona of a **'knowledgeable and empathetic friend'** as described in the `Tone Guide`.

- **Refer back to the `Tone Guide` and `Sample Articles` frequently**, especially when drafting introductions, transitions, explanations of complex topics, and the 'Key Insight' section.
- **Consciously use techniques from the `Tone Guide`:** direct address ("you," "your"), contractions, occasional rhetorical questions (max 1 per 500 words), gentle self-deprecation where appropriate.
- **Prioritize accessibility:** Explain scientific concepts using analogies, metaphors, and plain language *before or alongside* technical terms. *Imagine you're explaining this to a smart friend who isn't a scientist.*
- **Inject personality:** Look for natural opportunities for light, appropriate humor or relatable scenarios.
- **Actively translate analytical findings into this conversational and empathetic voice.** Don't just report the facts; frame them in a way that connects with the reader's experience and concerns.

### Tonal Scaffolding

For sections identified in the outline with tonal prompts (or other complex sections), consider *first* drafting 2-3 sentences of pure conversational explanation or a relatable scenario *without* immediately inserting citations or dense scientific detail. This establishes the "voice." *Then*, weave in the necessary claims and citations to support this initial friendly framing.

### Voice Techniques
- **Direct address**: Use "you" and "your" constantly
- **Contractions**: Always use them (don't, you're, we've, it's)
- **Conversational phrases**: "We've all been there," "Here's the thing," "Let's be honest"
- **Acknowledge the challenge**: "Choosing a multivitamin can feel overwhelming"
- **No condescension**: Respect the reader's intelligence while making science accessible

### Comparison-Specific Tone
- **Fair and balanced**: Present each product's strengths honestly
- **Subtle positioning**: Highlight DM-02™'s advantages through objective differences, not by disparaging competitors
- **Decision-focused**: Help the reader understand what matters for THEIR needs
- **Not a hard sell**: "If your priority is X, [Competitor] might work. If you want Y, DM-02™ offers..."

### Language Style
- Short sentences (average under 25 words)
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Plain language before technical terms
- Analogies and metaphors to explain complex concepts
- 7th-8th grade reading level (Flesch-Kincaid)

---

## **COMPLIANCE RULES**

Strictly adhere to `Compliance Rules` and `NO-NO WORDS.csv`. Double-check all claims against approved language.

### DO:
- Use "DM-02™ is *formulated to*" when making claims
- All claims are ingredient-level claims
- Use the ™ symbol when using the product name
- State vitamins are in "bioavailable forms"

### DO NOT:
- State vitamins are in their "*most* bioavailable" forms
- State or imply DM-02™ addresses any chronic condition
- State DM-02™ *delivers* ingredients directly to the colon (it is *engineered* to do so)
- Use verbs like *improve, boost, strengthen* - use *support, contribute to, promote*
- Say "DM-02™ supports..." - say "DM-02™ is formulated to support..." or "DM-02™ contains ingredients that support..."
- Use any words from the NO-NO WORDS list

### Product Link Format
All mentions of Seed products MUST include trademark symbols and be hyperlinked:
- `[DM-02™ Daily Multivitamin](https://seed.com/daily-multivitamin)`
- `[DS-01® Daily Synbiotic](https://seed.com/daily-synbiotic)` (if mentioned)

---

## **SIMPLIFICATION PASS**

After drafting, perform a comprehensive simplification review:

### 1. Sentence Simplification
- Break any sentence over 30 words into two shorter sentences
- Replace semicolons with periods in most cases
- Ensure average sentence length stays under 25 words

### 2. Language Accessibility
- Replace academic jargon with plain language equivalents
- Define technical terms immediately after introducing them
- Use common words over complex synonyms

### 3. Paragraph Structure
- Split any paragraph with 4+ sentences
- Ensure each paragraph focuses on one main idea
- Add simple transition sentences between complex concepts

### 4. Readability Checks
- Apply the "grandmother test" - would a smart grandparent understand this?
- Read aloud to catch awkward phrasing
- Ensure 7th-8th grade reading level (Flesch-Kincaid)

### 5. Flow and Coherence
- Add connecting phrases between sections
- Ensure logical progression of ideas
