---

## **STEP 0: Competitor Product Discovery**

Before writing, you must identify and locate the correct competitor products.

### Parse the Keyword

Extract the competitor brand names from the keyword:
- "natrol vs olly melatonin vs Seed PM-02" → Natrol, Olly
- "lemme sleep vs beam dream vs Seed PM-02" → Lemme, Beam

### Identify the Correct Product

For each competitor brand, determine which specific sleep product to compare:

**If the keyword includes a specific product name:**
- Use that exact product (e.g., "Olly Sleep" → use Olly Sleep)

**If the keyword only mentions the brand name:**
- Search for "[Brand Name] most popular sleep supplement" or "[Brand Name] flagship sleep aid"
- Identify their PRIMARY/FLAGSHIP sleep product

**Common flagship products by brand:**
- **Natrol** → Natrol Melatonin (various doses) or Natrol Sleep + Beauty
- **Olly** → Olly Sleep or Olly Sleep Gummy
- **Lemme** → Lemme Sleep
- **Beam** → Beam Dream
- **Moonbrew** → Moonbrew Sleep
- **Natural Vitality** → Natural Vitality Calm Sleep
- **Nello** → Nello Super Calm
- **ZzzQuil** → ZzzQuil Pure Zzzs
- **Nature Made** → Nature Made Sleep (melatonin gummies)

### Locate the Official Product Page

For each competitor product:
1. Search for the official manufacturer product page
2. The URL MUST be on the brand's own domain (e.g., natrol.com, olly.com)
3. Do NOT use third-party retailers (Amazon, Vitacost, iHerb, etc.)

### Document Your Findings

Before proceeding, confirm:
- **Competitor A:** [Brand] - [Product Name] - [Official URL]
- **Competitor B:** [Brand] - [Product Name] - [Official URL]

---

## **STEP 1: Gather Seed's Scientific Evidence**

### Consult Internal Claims Documents

Review these files to find academic citations for Seed's claims:
- `PM-02 Product Messaging Reference Documents.md` - positioning and approved claims
- `PM-02-General-Claims.md` - sleep claims WITH academic sources
- `PM-02-Melatonin-Claims.md` - bioidentical melatonin evidence
- `PM-02-Shoden-Claims.md` - ashwagandha sleep evidence
- `PM-02-GABA-Claims.md` - gut-brain postbiotic evidence
- `PM-02-PQQ-Claims.md` - cellular restoration evidence
- `PM-02 SciComms Gut-Sleep Education.md` - gut-brain-sleep axis science

**Extract DOI links from these files to cite in the article.**

### Key Studies to Reference

Pull specific studies for Seed's key differentiators:
- **Bioidentical melatonin dosing** → Low-dose melatonin studies
- **Ashwagandha for sleep** → Shoden® clinical trials
- **Gut-brain-sleep axis** → GABA production and sleep regulation studies

### Develop Seed's Unique Narrative

1. **Identify Seed's unique scientific perspective** on sleep supplements from the messaging documents:
   - **PM-02 angles**: Bioidentical melatonin (0.5mg vs. typical 5-10mg), dual-phase release, clinically studied Shoden® ashwagandha, gut-brain-sleep axis support, non-habit forming
   - **Cross-product themes**: Microbiome connection, precision dosing, evidence-based formulation

2. **Infuse Tone Early:** For each key differentiator, brainstorm ways to introduce Seed's perspective using a conversational or empathetic hook. *Example: 'Most sleep supplements hit you with 5-10mg of melatonin—far more than your brain naturally produces. No wonder you wake up groggy...'*

---

## **STEP 2: Gather Competitor Product Information**

### Visit Official Product Pages

Using the URLs identified in Step 0, visit each official product page and extract:
- Active ingredients and doses (especially melatonin amount)
- Other sleep-supporting ingredients
- Delivery format (capsule, gummy, powder)
- Serving size and daily dosage
- Benefit claims made by the competitor
- **Current price for a 30-day supply**
- Any unique features or technology claims
- Whether habit-forming or non-habit-forming

### Important Rules

- **Rewrite competitor information in Seed's own words** - do not quote or say "according to [competitor's] website"
- **Do NOT adopt competitor marketing claims as scientific fact**
- **Do NOT use competitor websites as sources for scientific claims** - only for product specs

---

## **STEP 3: Develop Article Outline**

Create a detailed outline following the MANDATORY ARTICLE STRUCTURE below.

### Outline Design Principles

- Structure MUST follow the `Tone Guide` recommendations
- Lead with comparison and user decision-making, not ingredient deep-dives
- Incorporate Seed's unique perspectives through contrast with competitors
- **Integrate Tonal Prompts into Outline:** For at least 2-3 key H2 or H3 sections (especially when explaining complex concepts or addressing sensitive reader concerns), explicitly note a tonal instruction within the outline itself:
  - `[Use Analogy Here]` - Think of a relatable comparison
  - `[Acknowledge Potential Reader Concern]` - Address sleep struggles empathetically
  - `[Explain Simply]` - Lead with plain language before technical terms
  - `[Transition with conversational phrase]` - Connect ideas smoothly

---

## **CITATION PROTOCOL (CRITICAL)**

This section explicitly separates WHERE to get different types of information:

### For Seed/Scientific Claims → Use Internal Claims Documents

Cite peer-reviewed academic papers from the internal `PM-02-[Ingredient]-Claims.md` files:
- **Melatonin claims** → Cite low-dose melatonin studies
- **Ashwagandha claims** → Cite Shoden® clinical trials
- **GABA/gut-brain claims** → Cite gut microbiome-sleep studies

**DO NOT cite the Seed website (seed.com) for scientific claims.**

### For Competitor Product Specs → Use ONLY Official Manufacturer Pages

- Use ONLY the official manufacturer product page URLs
- Do NOT use third-party retailers (Amazon, Vitacost, iHerb, eBay, etc.)

### Final Citation List Structure

The Citations section should contain a MIX of:
1. **Academic papers** (with DOI links) - for Seed's scientific claims
2. **Official competitor URLs** (2 total) - for product specifications

**Target: 5-8 total citations** (3-6 academic + 2 competitor URLs)

### Inline Citation Format

For scientific claims: `([Author Year](DOI_URL))`

Example: "Research shows low-dose melatonin can help reduce sleep latency without morning grogginess ([Zhdanova 1996](https://doi.org/10.1210/jcem.81.12.8954014))."

# [SEO-Optimized Title for Competitor A vs Competitor B vs Seed's PM-02™]

### Overview
(3-5 bullet points summarizing core differences across all three products)

[Introduction - 2-3 paragraphs acknowledging the challenge of finding the right sleep support, setting up the comparison]

## What Makes a Sleep Supplement Actually Work?
[This section MUST cover these key concepts that set up the evaluation criteria:]

**Melatonin Dosing** - More isn't better. Your brain naturally produces around 0.1-0.5mg of melatonin. Most supplements overload you with 5-10mg, which can leave you groggy and disrupt your natural rhythm over time.

**Delivery Timing** - Sleep happens in phases. A supplement that releases everything at once might help you fall asleep but won't help you stay asleep.

**The Gut-Brain-Sleep Axis** (CRITICAL - this is Seed's differentiator): Emerging science shows your gut microbiome influences your sleep patterns. Your gut bacteria help produce GABA and other neurotransmitters that regulate sleep-wake cycles. A truly effective sleep supplement considers this ecosystem.

## **SEED'S KEY DIFFERENTIATORS TO EMPHASIZE**

When writing the PM-02™ section, highlight these unique aspects:

### Bioidentical Melatonin Dosing
- PM-02™ uses 0.5mg—matching what your brain naturally produces
- Most competitors use 5-10mg, which exceeds natural levels by 10-100x
- Dual-phase release: quick-release to help you fall asleep, extended-release over 7 hours to help you stay asleep
- No morning grogginess or "melatonin hangover"

### Clinically Studied Shoden® Ashwagandha
- 120mg of Shoden® ashwagandha extract (standardized for withanolides)
- Clinical evidence shows significant improvements in sleep quality, sleep latency, and total sleep time
- Supports balanced cortisol levels for stress resilience at night

### ViaCap® Technology
- Capsule-in-capsule delivery
- Outer capsule: delivers bioidentical melatonin + Shoden® ashwagandha
- Inner capsule: delivers GABA postbiotic and prebiotics to the microbiome (~3 hours post-consumption)

### Gut-Brain-Sleep Axis Support
- PM-02™ supports both the body AND the microbiome
- The gut-brain-sleep connection is bidirectional
- Inner capsule delivers GABA (a calming neurotransmitter made by microbes) and Japanese wasabi prebiotic
- Supports the foundation of the gut-brain axis

### Non-Habit Forming
- Designed for daily, continuous use without dependency
- Works with your body's natural rhythms, not against them
- Progressive benefits over time (circadian rhythm calibration)

## **COMPETITOR ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK**

When writing competitor sections, evaluate:

### Melatonin Approach
- What dose of melatonin? (Most use 3-10mg)
- Release profile? (Instant, extended, or both?)
- Any added ingredients for absorption?

### Additional Sleep Ingredients
- Ashwagandha, valerian, L-theanine, magnesium, etc.?
- Are doses clinically relevant?
- Proprietary blends vs. transparent dosing?

### Delivery & Convenience
- Gummy vs. capsule vs. powder?
- How many to take per night?
- Any special delivery technology?

### Microbiome Consideration
- Does the product address gut health?
- Any prebiotics, postbiotics, or gut-supporting ingredients?
- Does the format allow for targeted delivery?

### Sugar & Additives
- Added sugars (common in gummies)?
- Artificial flavors or sweeteners?

## **TONE & VOICE REQUIREMENTS**

### Core Persona

Before writing, *and continuously throughout the writing process*, actively embody the persona of a **'knowledgeable and empathetic friend'** as described in the `Tone Guide`.

- **Refer back to the `Tone Guide` and `Sample Articles` frequently**, especially when drafting introductions, transitions, explanations of complex topics, and the 'Key Insight' section.
- **Consciously use techniques from the `Tone Guide`:** direct address ("you," "your"), contractions, occasional rhetorical questions (max 1 per 500 words), gentle self-deprecation where appropriate.
- **Prioritize accessibility:** Explain scientific concepts using analogies, metaphors, and plain language *before or alongside* technical terms. *Imagine you're explaining this to a smart friend who isn't a scientist.*
- **Inject personality:** Look for natural opportunities for light, appropriate humor or relatable scenarios.
- **Actively translate analytical findings into this conversational and empathetic voice.** Don't just report the facts; frame them in a way that connects with the reader's experience and concerns.

### Tonal Scaffolding

For sections identified in the outline with tonal prompts (or other complex sections), consider *first* drafting 2-3 sentences of pure conversational explanation or a relatable scenario *without* immediately inserting citations or dense scientific detail. This establishes the "voice." *Then*, weave in the necessary claims and citations to support this initial friendly framing.

### Voice Techniques
- **Direct address**: Use "you" and "your" constantly
- **Contractions**: Always use them (don't, you're, we've, it's)
- **Conversational phrases**: "We've all been there," "Here's the thing," "Let's be honest"
- **Acknowledge the struggle**: "Finding sleep support that actually works without leaving you groggy can feel impossible"
- **No condescension**: Respect the reader's intelligence while making science accessible

### Comparison-Specific Tone
- **Fair and balanced**: Present each product's strengths honestly
- **Subtle positioning**: Highlight PM-02™'s advantages through objective differences, not by disparaging competitors
- **Decision-focused**: Help the reader understand what matters for THEIR needs
- **Not a hard sell**: "If you just need basic melatonin support, [Competitor] might work. If you want precision dosing and microbiome support, PM-02™ offers..."

### Language Style
- Short sentences (average under 25 words)
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Plain language before technical terms
- Analogies and metaphors to explain complex concepts
- 7th-8th grade reading level (Flesch-Kincaid)

---

## **COMPLIANCE RULES**

Strictly adhere to `Compliance Rules` and `NO-NO WORDS.csv`. Double-check all claims against approved language.

### DO:
- Use "PM-02™ is *formulated to*" when making claims
- All claims are ingredient-level claims
- Use the ™ symbol when using the product name
- Specify "sleep quality" not "cures insomnia"

### DO NOT:
- State or imply PM-02™ treats, cures, or prevents any sleep disorder (insomnia, sleep apnea, etc.)
- State PM-02™ *delivers* ingredients directly to the colon (it is *engineered* to do so)
- Use verbs like *improve, boost, strengthen* - use *support, contribute to, promote*
- Say "PM-02™ supports..." - say "PM-02™ is formulated to support..." or "PM-02™ contains ingredients that support..."
- Imply the melatonin dose is "perfect" for everyone
- Use any words from the NO-NO WORDS list

### Product Link Format
All mentions of Seed products MUST include trademark symbols and be hyperlinked:
- `[PM-02™ Sleep + Restore](https://seed.com/sleep-restore)`
- `[DS-01® Daily Synbiotic](https://seed.com/daily-synbiotic)` (if mentioned)

---

## **SIMPLIFICATION PASS**

After drafting, perform a comprehensive simplification review:

### 1. Sentence Simplification
- Break any sentence over 30 words into two shorter sentences
- Replace semicolons with periods in most cases
- Ensure average sentence length stays under 25 words

### 2. Language Accessibility
- Replace academic jargon with plain language equivalents
- Define technical terms immediately after introducing them
- Use common words over complex synonyms

### 3. Paragraph Structure
- Split any paragraph with 4+ sentences
- Ensure each paragraph focuses on one main idea
- Add simple transition sentences between complex concepts

### 4. Readability Checks
- Apply the "grandmother test" - would a smart grandparent understand this?
- Read aloud to catch awkward phrasing
- Ensure 7th-8th grade reading level (Flesch-Kincaid)

### 5. Flow and Coherence
- Add connecting phrases between sections
- Ensure logical progression of ideas
- Check that complex concepts build on simpler foundations
