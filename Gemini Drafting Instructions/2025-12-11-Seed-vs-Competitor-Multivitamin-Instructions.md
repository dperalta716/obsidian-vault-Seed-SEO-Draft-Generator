**BEGIN SUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUCTIONS - SEED VS. COMPETITOR MULTIVITAMIN COMPARISONS**

**Purpose:** These supplemental instructions are for generating three-way comparison articles comparing Seed's DM-02™ Daily Multivitamin against two competitor multivitamin products.

**Keyword:** life extension vs pure encapsulations multivitamin vs Seed DM-02

**Competitor product pages**: 

---

## **⚠️ IMPORTANT: No Stage 1 Analysis for This Workflow**

**This workflow does NOT use a `stage1_analysis-[KEYWORD].md` document.**

Unlike standard keyword articles, comparison articles gather competitor information directly from the competitor's official product pages provided by the user. Do not expect or look for a stage 1 analysis document.

**Instead, this workflow requires:**
1. The **keyword** (e.g., "life extension vs pure encapsulations multivitamin vs Seed DM-02")
2. **Two competitor product page URLs** provided by the user
3. Direct consultation of Seed's internal DM-02 reference documents

**Example Keywords:**
- `life extension vs pure encapsulations multivitamin vs Seed DM-02`
- `metagenics vs pure encapsulations multivitamin vs Seed DM-02`
- `vitafusion vs olly womens multivitamin vs Seed DM-02`
- `ritual vs care/of multivitamin vs Seed DM-02`
- `thorne vs garden of life multivitamin vs Seed DM-02`

## **Competitor Information Gathering & Usage**

### **Step A: Internal Perspective First**

Before external searches, thoroughly review:
- `DM-02 Product Messaging Reference Documents.md` for Seed's positioning, differentiators, and approved claims
- `DM-02-Key-Benefits-Claims.md` for substantiated benefit claims
- `DM-02-General-Claims.md` for gut-nutrition connection claims
- `DM-02 Gut-Nutrition Education.md` for the science behind microbiome-nutrition support

This perspective will shape your analysis and establish Seed's scientific authority.

### **Step B: Visit Competitor Official Product Websites**

The user will provide URLs for the official product pages of both competitor multivitamins. You MUST visit these pages to gather:
- Exact vitamins and minerals included (and their forms if listed)
- Number of nutrients and % daily values
- Any additional ingredients (herbs, antioxidants, specialty compounds)
- Capsules/tablets per serving and servings per container
- Delivery format (capsule, tablet, gummy, powder)
- Benefit claims made by the competitor
- **Current price for a 30-day supply**
- Allergen and quality testing information
- Any unique features or technology claims

### **Step C: Synthesize with Seed's Authoritative Voice**

- Use factual details from competitor websites to populate the descriptive sections and comparison table
- All analysis, comparative framing, and discussion of implications MUST be presented organically as Seed's authoritative voice
- Do NOT write "According to the DM-02 messaging documents..." - integrate insights naturally
- **CRITICAL: Do NOT adopt competitor marketing claims as scientific fact.** Your lens for evaluating competitors is always Seed's scientific perspective on bioavailability, microbiome support, and evidence-based formulation
- **Rewrite competitor information in Seed's own words** - do not quote from competitor websites or say "according to [competitor's] website"

## **DM-02™ Information Sources**

Refer extensively to:
- `DM-02 Product Messaging Reference Documents.md` (for positioning, claims, price: $39.99/30-day supply)
- `DM-02-Key-Benefits-Claims.md` (for substantiated health claims)
- `DM-02-General-Claims.md` (for gut-nutrition science claims)
- `DM-02 Gut-Nutrition Education.md` (for microbiome-nutrition connection content)
- Individual ingredient claims files in `/Reference/Claims/DM-02/` as needed

**DM-02™ benefits MUST be explicitly and accurately detailed** using the specific language found in these documents throughout the article, especially in:
- The dedicated benefits subsection
- The comparison table
- The Key Insight section

## **Seed's Key Differentiators to Emphasize**

When comparing DM-02™ to competitors, highlight these unique aspects:

### **Microbiome Support**
- DM-02™ is designed to support both the body AND the microbiome
- The gut-nutrition connection is bidirectional: nutrients shape the microbiome, and the microbiome shapes nutrient availability
- Inner capsule delivers B vitamins and prebiotics (Japanese wasabi) to support gut bacteria

### **Bioavailable Forms**
- Methylfolate (not folic acid)
- Methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin (B12)
- Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (B6)
- Cholecalciferol/D3 (not D2)
- Chelated minerals (e.g., manganese bisglycinate)

### **Cellular Energy Complex (Unique to DM-02™)**
- CoQ10 (declines with age, supports mitochondrial function)
- PQQ (supports mitochondrial biogenesis)
- Spermidine (cellular renewal compound)
- Vitamin K2 MK-7 (longer-lasting, microbially-produced form)

### **ViaCap® Technology**
- Capsule-in-capsule delivery
- Outer capsule: releases vitamins/minerals in upper GI tract
- Inner capsule: delivers nutrients to the microbiome (~3 hours post-consumption)

### **Precision Dosing**
- 100% DV of 20 vitamins and minerals
- No mega-doses or micro-doses
- Designed to complement a healthy diet, not replace it

### **Quality & Safety**
- Tested for heavy metals
- Free of gluten, soy, dairy, corn
- Glyphosate/AMPA free
- Prop 65 compliant

---

## **Competitor Analysis Framework**

When analyzing competitors, evaluate and note:

### **Formulation Quality**
- Are vitamins in bioavailable/active forms or synthetic/inactive forms?
- Are minerals chelated or in oxide/carbonate forms (poorly absorbed)?
- Do they include meaningful amounts or "fairy dust" doses?

### **Completeness**
- How many vitamins and minerals are included?
- Are there notable gaps (e.g., no vitamin K, no trace minerals)?
- Do they include any specialty compounds (CoQ10, etc.)?

### **Delivery & Convenience**
- How many pills/capsules per day?
- Is it a tablet (harder to absorb), capsule, gummy (often contains sugar/fillers)?
- Any special delivery technology?

### **Microbiome Consideration**
- Does the product address gut health at all?
- Any prebiotics or gut-supporting ingredients?

### **Value Proposition**
- Price per 30-day supply
- Cost per nutrient/per capsule
- What you get for what you pay

---

## **Tone of Comparison**

- Maintain Seed's friendly, educational, and empathetic tone
- Frame comparison from Seed's scientific perspective
- It is appropriate to subtly highlight DM-02™'s advantages based on objective differences in formulation, bioavailability, and microbiome support
- **Do NOT directly disparage competitors** - focus on objective differences and what science indicates about those differences
- Acknowledge that different products may suit different needs, but position DM-02™ as the choice for those who want comprehensive, science-backed nutrition with microbiome support

---

## **Copy Compliance Reminders**

### ✅ DO:
- Use the operative description "DM-02™ is *formulated to*" when making claims
- All claims are ingredient-level claims
- Use the ™ symbol when using the product name
- State that vitamins and minerals are in "bioavailable forms"

### ❌ DO NOT:
- State vitamins are in their "*most* bioavailable" forms
- State or imply DM-02™ addresses any chronic condition
- State DM-02™ *delivers* ingredients directly to the colon (it is *engineered* to do so)
- Use verbs like *improve, boost, strengthen* - use *support, contribute to, promote*
- Say "DM-02™ supports..." - say "DM-02™ is formulated to support..." or "DM-02™ contains ingredients that support..."

---

## **Product Link Format**

All mentions of Seed products MUST include trademark symbols and be hyperlinked:
- `[DM-02™ Daily Multivitamin](https://seed.com/daily-multivitamin)`
- `[DS-01® Daily Synbiotic](https://seed.com/daily-synbiotic)` (if mentioned for context)

- Target 12-15 academic sources maximum
- The perspectives from Seed's internal documents should be seamlessly integrated into the article's voice
- Ensure 7th-8th grade reading level (Flesch-Kincaid)
