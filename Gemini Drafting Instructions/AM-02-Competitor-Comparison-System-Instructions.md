---

## **STEP 0: Competitor Product Discovery**

Before writing, you must identify and locate the correct competitor products.

### Parse the Keyword

Extract the competitor brand names from the keyword:
- "mind lab pro vs alpha brain vs Seed AM-02" → Mind Lab Pro, Alpha Brain
- "magic mind vs qualia mind vs Seed AM-02" → Magic Mind, Qualia Mind

### Identify the Correct Product

For each competitor brand, determine which specific nootropic/energy product to compare:

**If the keyword includes a specific product name:**
- Use that exact product (e.g., "Alpha Brain" → use Alpha Brain)

**If the keyword only mentions the brand name:**
- Search for "[Brand Name] most popular nootropic" or "[Brand Name] flagship focus supplement"
- Identify their PRIMARY/FLAGSHIP cognitive/energy product

**Common flagship products by brand:**
- **Alpha Brain** → Alpha Brain (Original) or Alpha Brain Black Label
- **Mind Lab Pro** → Mind Lab Pro (Universal Nootropic)
- **Qualia Mind** → Qualia Mind
- **Magic Mind** → Magic Mind (productivity shot)
- **Vyvamind** → Vyvamind
- **Noocube** → Noocube
- **Thesis** → Thesis (personalized nootropics)
- **Onnit** → Alpha Brain or New Mood
- **Neuriva** → Neuriva Plus

### Locate the Official Product Page

For each competitor product:
1. Search for the official manufacturer product page
2. The URL MUST be on the brand's own domain (e.g., onnit.com, mindlabpro.com)
3. Do NOT use third-party retailers (Amazon, Vitacost, iHerb, etc.)

### Document Your Findings

Before proceeding, confirm:
- **Competitor A:** [Brand] - [Product Name] - [Official URL]
- **Competitor B:** [Brand] - [Product Name] - [Official URL]

---

## **STEP 1: Gather Seed's Scientific Evidence**

### Consult Internal Claims Documents

Review these files to find academic citations for Seed's claims:
- `AM-02 Product Messaging Reference Documents.md` - positioning and approved claims
- `AM-02-General-Claims.md` - cognitive/energy claims WITH academic sources
- `AM-02-Cereboost-Claims.md` - ginseng cognitive evidence
- `AM-02-Theacrine-Claims.md` - sustained energy evidence
- `AM-02-CoQ10-Claims.md` - cellular energy evidence
- `AM-02-PQQ-Claims.md` - mitochondrial support evidence
- `AM-02 SciComms Gut-Energy Education.md` - gut-brain-energy axis science

**Extract DOI links from these files to cite in the article.**

### Key Studies to Reference

Pull specific studies for Seed's key differentiators:
- **Cereboost® cognitive benefits** → Ginseng clinical trials on attention and focus
- **Theacrine sustained energy** → Theacrine energy and mood studies
- **Gut-brain-energy axis** → Microbiome and cognitive function studies

### Develop Seed's Unique Narrative

1. **Identify Seed's unique scientific perspective** on nootropics from the messaging documents:
   - **AM-02 angles**: CAFFEINE-FREE, Multi-Peak Energy Complex (staggered activation), clinically studied nootropics (Cereboost®, TeaCrine®), gut-brain axis support, no jitters/crash, sustained cognitive performance
   - **Cross-product themes**: Microbiome connection, evidence-based formulation, mental energy (not physical)

2. **Infuse Tone Early:** For each key differentiator, brainstorm ways to introduce Seed's perspective using a conversational or empathetic hook. *Example: 'Most energy supplements hit you with caffeine and call it a day. An hour later, you're crashing harder than before...'*

---

## **STEP 2: Gather Competitor Product Information**

### Visit Official Product Pages

Using the URLs identified in Step 0, visit each official product page and extract:
- Active ingredients and doses (especially caffeine content)
- Nootropic compounds included
- Delivery format (capsule, powder, shot)
- Serving size and daily dosage
- Benefit claims made by the competitor
- **Current price for a 30-day supply**
- Any unique features or technology claims
- Stimulant vs. non-stimulant approach

### Important Rules

- **Rewrite competitor information in Seed's own words** - do not quote or say "according to [competitor's] website"
- **Do NOT adopt competitor marketing claims as scientific fact**
- **Do NOT use competitor websites as sources for scientific claims** - only for product specs

---

## **STEP 3: Develop Article Outline**

Create a detailed outline following the MANDATORY ARTICLE STRUCTURE below.

### Outline Design Principles

- Structure MUST follow the `Tone Guide` recommendations
- Lead with comparison and user decision-making, not ingredient deep-dives
- Incorporate Seed's unique perspectives through contrast with competitors
- **Integrate Tonal Prompts into Outline:** For at least 2-3 key H2 or H3 sections (especially when explaining complex concepts or addressing sensitive reader concerns), explicitly note a tonal instruction within the outline itself:
  - `[Use Analogy Here]` - Think of a relatable comparison
  - `[Acknowledge Potential Reader Concern]` - Address caffeine fatigue empathetically
  - `[Explain Simply]` - Lead with plain language before technical terms
  - `[Transition with conversational phrase]` - Connect ideas smoothly

---

## **CITATION PROTOCOL (CRITICAL)**

This section explicitly separates WHERE to get different types of information:

### For Seed/Scientific Claims → Use Internal Claims Documents

Cite peer-reviewed academic papers from the internal `AM-02-[Ingredient]-Claims.md` files:
- **Ginseng/cognitive claims** → Cite Cereboost® clinical studies
- **Energy/theacrine claims** → Cite TeaCrine® studies
- **Gut-brain claims** → Cite gut microbiome-cognition studies

**DO NOT cite the Seed website (seed.com) for scientific claims.**

### For Competitor Product Specs → Use ONLY Official Manufacturer Pages

- Use ONLY the official manufacturer product page URLs
- Do NOT use third-party retailers (Amazon, Vitacost, iHerb, eBay, etc.)

### Final Citation List Structure

The Citations section should contain a MIX of:
1. **Academic papers** (with DOI links) - for Seed's scientific claims
2. **Official competitor URLs** (2 total) - for product specifications

**Target: 5-8 total citations** (3-6 academic + 2 competitor URLs)

### Inline Citation Format

For scientific claims: `([Author Year](DOI_URL))`

Example: "Research shows Cereboost® ginseng can improve working memory and attention within hours of consumption ([Scholey 2010](https://doi.org/10.1002/hup.1113))."

# [SEO-Optimized Title for Competitor A vs Competitor B vs Seed's AM-02™]

### Overview
(3-5 bullet points summarizing core differences across all three products)

[Introduction - 2-3 paragraphs acknowledging the challenge of finding sustainable focus and energy, setting up the comparison]

## What Makes a Nootropic Actually Work?
[This section MUST cover these key concepts that set up the evaluation criteria:]

**Energy Source** - There's a difference between stimulant-based energy (caffeine) and cellular energy. Caffeine gives you a temporary spike by blocking adenosine, but doesn't actually create energy. True sustained energy comes from supporting your mitochondria.

**Onset and Duration** - How quickly do effects kick in? How long do they last? A single-ingredient approach often means a single spike and crash. A well-designed formula considers staggered activation.

**The Gut-Brain-Energy Axis** (CRITICAL - this is Seed's differentiator): Emerging science shows your gut microbiome directly influences cognitive function and energy levels. Your gut bacteria produce neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, and GABA that affect how you think and feel. A truly effective nootropic considers this ecosystem.

## **TONE & VOICE REQUIREMENTS**

### Core Persona

Before writing, *and continuously throughout the writing process*, actively embody the persona of a **'knowledgeable and empathetic friend'** as described in the `Tone Guide`.

- **Refer back to the `Tone Guide` and `Sample Articles` frequently**, especially when drafting introductions, transitions, explanations of complex topics, and the 'Key Insight' section.
- **Consciously use techniques from the `Tone Guide`:** direct address ("you," "your"), contractions, occasional rhetorical questions (max 1 per 500 words), gentle self-deprecation where appropriate.
- **Prioritize accessibility:** Explain scientific concepts using analogies, metaphors, and plain language *before or alongside* technical terms. *Imagine you're explaining this to a smart friend who isn't a scientist.*
- **Inject personality:** Look for natural opportunities for light, appropriate humor or relatable scenarios.
- **Actively translate analytical findings into this conversational and empathetic voice.** Don't just report the facts; frame them in a way that connects with the reader's experience and concerns.

### Tonal Scaffolding

For sections identified in the outline with tonal prompts (or other complex sections), consider *first* drafting 2-3 sentences of pure conversational explanation or a relatable scenario *without* immediately inserting citations or dense scientific detail. This establishes the "voice." *Then*, weave in the necessary claims and citations to support this initial friendly framing.

### Voice Techniques
- **Direct address**: Use "you" and "your" constantly
- **Contractions**: Always use them (don't, you're, we've, it's)
- **Conversational phrases**: "We've all been there," "Here's the thing," "Let's be honest"
- **Acknowledge the struggle**: "That 3pm slump is real—and another cup of coffee isn't always the answer"
- **No condescension**: Respect the reader's intelligence while making science accessible

### Comparison-Specific Tone
- **Fair and balanced**: Present each product's strengths honestly
- **Subtle positioning**: Highlight AM-02™'s advantages through objective differences, not by disparaging competitors
- **Decision-focused**: Help the reader understand what matters for THEIR needs
- **Not a hard sell**: "If you don't mind caffeine and want a quick boost, [Competitor] might work. If you want sustained, crash-free focus, AM-02™ offers..."
- **Don't demonize caffeine**: Many users still enjoy coffee with their AM-02™

### Language Style
- Short sentences (average under 25 words)
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Plain language before technical terms
- Analogies and metaphors to explain complex concepts
- 7th-8th grade reading level (Flesch-Kincaid)

---

## **COMPLIANCE RULES**

Strictly adhere to `Compliance Rules` and `NO-NO WORDS.csv`. Double-check all claims against approved language.

### DO:
- Use "AM-02™ is *formulated to*" when making claims
- All claims are ingredient-level claims
- Use the ™ symbol when using the product name
- Specify "mental energy" not "physical energy"
- Use tradenames: Cereboost® Ginseng Root, TeaCrine® Theacrine

### DO NOT:
- State or imply AM-02™ treats ADHD, chronic fatigue, or any cognitive condition
- State AM-02™ *delivers* ingredients directly to the colon (it is *engineered* to do so)
- Use verbs like *improve, boost, strengthen* - use *support, contribute to, promote*
- Say "AM-02™ supports..." - say "AM-02™ is formulated to support..." or "AM-02™ contains ingredients that support..."
- Use "boost" (AM-02™ is not an "energy booster")
- Demonize caffeine
- Imply it supports physical energy or athletic performance
- Use any words from the NO-NO WORDS list

### Product Link Format
All mentions of Seed products MUST include trademark symbols and be hyperlinked:
- `[AM-02™ Energy + Focus](https://seed.com/energy-focus)`
- `[DS-01® Daily Synbiotic](https://seed.com/daily-synbiotic)` (if mentioned)

- Ensure each paragraph focuses on one main idea
- Add simple transition sentences between complex concepts

### 4. Readability Checks
- Apply the "grandmother test" - would a smart grandparent understand this?
- Read aloud to catch awkward phrasing
- Ensure 7th-8th grade reading level (Flesch-Kincaid)

### 5. Flow and Coherence
- Add connecting phrases between sections
- Ensure logical progression of ideas
- Check that complex concepts build on simpler foundations
