# review-draft-1-v2

Review generated SEO articles against Seed's scientific perspective (Claims docs, NPD Messaging, SciComms) FIRST, then quality/compliance checks.

## Usage

- `/review-draft-1-v2` - Reviews the most recent draft in /Generated-Drafts/
- `/review-draft-1-v2 filename.md` - Reviews a specific file
- `/review-draft-1-v2 keyword` - Reviews draft containing keyword in filename

## What This Command Does

This command performs a **two-tier comprehensive review**:

1. **PRIMARY (40% weight):** Grades article against **Seed's scientific perspective** - Claims documents, NPD Messaging, and relevant SciComms content
2. **SECONDARY (60% weight):** Quality and compliance checks (citations, tone, structure, SEO)

The key innovation: **Smart relevance detection** - only checks for SciComms content that's actually relevant to the article's topic, avoiding unnecessary bloat.

## Implementation

When this command runs:

### STEP 1: File Identification

Identify which file to review (same logic as review-draft-1):
- If no argument: Find most recent v1-*.md file in `/Generated-Drafts/` subdirectories
- If argument looks like filename: Use that specific file
- If argument is keyword: Find keyword folder and use latest version

### STEP 2: Product Auto-Detection

**Scan the article to determine which product it covers:**

1. **Look for explicit product mentions:**
   - PM-02® or "Sleep + Restore" → PM-02
   - DM-02® or "Daily Multivitamin" → DM-02
   - AM-02® or "Energy + Focus" → AM-02

2. **Check for product-specific ingredients:**
   - Melatonin → PM-02
   - Multivitamin, comprehensive vitamins/minerals → DM-02
   - Energy, mitochondrial function, nootropics → AM-02

3. **Analyze keyword patterns:**
   - "sleep", "circadian", "melatonin" → PM-02
   - "multivitamin", "nutrient gaps", "daily vitamin" → DM-02
   - "energy", "focus", "cognitive", "mitochondria" → AM-02

4. **If multiple products detected:** Choose primary focus based on keyword and main content
5. **If unclear:** Default to checking all three products and note this in output

**Load appropriate reference files based on detected product:**
- `/Reference/Claims/[PRODUCT]/[PRODUCT]-General-Claims.md`
- `/Reference/Claims/[PRODUCT]/[PRODUCT]-*-Claims.md` (all ingredient-specific files)
- `/Reference/NPD-Messaging/[PRODUCT] Product Messaging Reference Documents.md`
- `/Reference/SciComms Education Files/[PRODUCT] SciComms [Topic] Education.md`

Also load universal files:
- `/Reference/Compliance/NO-NO-WORDS.md`
- `/Reference/Compliance/What-We-Are-Not-Allowed-To-Say.md`
- `/Reference/Style/Seed-Tone-of-Voice-and-Structure.md`
- `/Reference/Style/8-Sample-Reference-Blog-Articles.md`

### STEP 3: Relevance Analysis (KEY INNOVATION)

**Before grading, analyze which SciComms content is actually relevant to THIS article:**

1. **Read the article's:**
   - Primary keyword
   - H2/H3 structure
   - Main topics covered
   - Specific ingredients discussed

2. **Identify relevant SciComms sections:**
   - Read through the SciComms Education file for detected product
   - Determine which talking points, narratives, and claims apply to THIS specific article
   - Flag sections that are relevant vs. those that would be bloat

3. **Create a relevance map:**
   ```
   Relevant SciComms Sections:
   - "Why Should you Take a Multivitamin with Microbiome Support" → Highly relevant
   - "The Gut-Nutrition Connection" → Relevant
   - "Nutrient Deficiencies And Inadequacies" → Highly relevant
   - Deep CoQ10 mechanism details → Not relevant for overview article
   ```

**Relevance Criteria:**
- **Highly relevant:** Core to answering the article's primary keyword
- **Relevant:** Provides supporting context or Seed's unique angle
- **Not relevant:** Too detailed, off-topic, or would bloat the article

**IMPORTANT:** Only check for "Highly relevant" and "Relevant" content in subsequent grading. Do NOT flag missing content that's "Not relevant."

### STEP 4: PRIMARY Grading (Most Important - 40% Weight)

Run 15 checks across 3 categories, using product-specific criteria:

## 📋 SEED SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVE CHECKS

### A. Claims Document Usage (5 checks - universal)

```

### STEP 7: Apply Fixes Based on User Response

Parse user's response and apply appropriate fixes:

**For 'seed' or Seed perspective category fixes (A, B, C):**

1. **Claims Document Integration:**
   - Identify which Claims doc studies should be cited
   - Replace or add citations with proper format: `([Author Year](DOI_URL))`
   - Ensure Claims docs are primary authority (>50% of citations)
   - Add missing health claims with proper attribution language

2. **NPD Messaging Alignment:**
   - **For DM-02:** Add soil depletion section, enhance microbiome-nutrition bidirectional discussion, add ViaCap® section, strengthen bioavailability examples, add critique of mega-dose multivitamins
   - **For PM-02:** Add precision dosing explanation, enhance sleep-gut-brain axis, add dual-phase release section, add high-dose melatonin critique, emphasize "not overloading" philosophy
   - **For AM-02:** Emphasize sustained vs. stimulant energy, enhance gut-mitochondria axis, strengthen cellular energy focus, add nootropic benefits, add stimulant product critique

3. **SciComms Integration:**
   - Add relevant talking points from SciComms file (only those marked relevant)
   - Incorporate applicable narratives from "Expanded Content Guide"
   - Add citations from SciComms docs where appropriate
   - Adjust Dirk Gevers quote if needed to better align with Seed's perspective

**For secondary category fixes:**

Apply fixes as defined in existing review-draft-1 command:
- **Tone fixes:** Add contractions, break up paragraphs, add plain language intros, add analogies
- **Compliance fixes:** Replace NO-NO words, soften medical claims, fix attribution
- **Citation fixes:** Fix formatting, add/remove as needed
- **Product reference fixes:** Add ® symbols, fix links, adjust focus to ingredients
- **Structure fixes:** Add missing sections with appropriate content
- **SEO fixes:** Adjust titles/descriptions, add keyword where missing

### STEP 8: Save Reviewed Version

1. **Determine next version number:**
   - If reviewing v1-[name].md → save as v2-reviewed.md
   - If reviewing v2-[name].md → save as v3-reviewed.md
   - etc.

2. **Save in same keyword subfolder as original**

3. **Show summary:**
   ```
   ✅ Review complete! Saved as: v2-reviewed.md

   Changes applied:
   - [Category 1]: X fixes
   - [Category 2]: Y fixes

   Major improvements:
   - Added soil depletion narrative
   - Integrated 7 Claims document citations
   - Enhanced bioavailability section with methylfolate example
   - Added ViaCap® technology explanation
   ```

4. **Preserve original file (never overwrite)**

## Important Notes

- **Product detection is automatic** but may need manual override in ambiguous cases
- **Relevance analysis is key** - prevents forcing irrelevant SciComms content
- **PRIMARY checks are most important** - these catch fundamental misalignment with Seed's perspective
- **Grading is hierarchical** - PRIMARY grade (A-F) is the headline, secondary is supporting detail
- **Smart about relevance** - only flags missing content that's actually relevant to the article's topic
- **Preserves original files always**
- **Version numbering is automatic**
- **Some issues may need manual intervention** (like writing new sections)
- **All fixes maintain article's core structure** while improving alignment with Seed's perspective

## Key Differences from review-draft-1

| Aspect | review-draft-1 | review-draft-1-v2 |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Priority** | All checks equal weight | Seed perspective first (40% weight) |
| **Claims Review** | Not included | Comprehensive Claims doc checking |
| **Messaging Check** | Not included | Product-specific NPD Messaging review |
| **SciComms** | Not included | Smart relevance-based SciComms review |
| **Product Detection** | Manual/implicit | Automatic with smart detection |
| **Grading** | Pass/fail by category | Letter grade for PRIMARY alignment |
| **Report Structure** | Single-tier flat list | Two-tier: PRIMARY then SECONDARY |
| **Relevance** | N/A | Analyzes what's relevant vs. bloat |

## Completion Output Format

When the command completes successfully and saves a new version, ALWAYS end with this exact format:

```
✅ Review complete!

Saved as: [FILENAME]
Location: [FULL_FOLDER_PATH]

Changes applied:
- [Summary of changes]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
📝 NEXT STEP (copy and paste this command):
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

/review-sources-2-v3 [FULL_PATH_TO_FILE_JUST_CREATED]
```

**CRITICAL:** The file path in the NEXT STEP must be the ACTUAL file that was just saved. Use the exact path including the version number that was created (e.g., `v3-reviewed.md`).
