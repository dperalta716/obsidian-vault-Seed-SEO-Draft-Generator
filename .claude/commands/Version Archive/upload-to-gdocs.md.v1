# upload-to-gdocs

Upload a SEO draft markdown file to Google Docs and update the tracking spreadsheet.

## Usage
```
/upload-to-gdocs <file-path>
```

## Description
This command automates the process of:
1. Creating a Google Doc from a markdown SEO draft
2. Updating the Phase 2 Tracking spreadsheet with the keyword, doc link, and status
3. Providing the Google Doc link for manual organization into the NPD drafts folder

## Implementation

When this command is invoked with a file path:

1. **Read the markdown file** at the provided path using the Read tool
   - Verify the file exists and is readable
   - Store the full content for later use

2. **Extract the primary keyword** from the metadata
   - Look for line 3 of the file, formatted as `**Primary keyword:** [keyword]`
   - Clean the extracted keyword (remove asterisks and "Primary keyword:" prefix)
   - This keyword will be used as the Google Doc title

3. **Create a Google Doc** using the Google Workspace MCP:
   - Use `mcp__google-workspace__create_doc` with:
     - `user_google_email`: "david@david-peralta.com"
     - `title`: The extracted primary keyword
     - `content`: The full markdown content from the file
   - The doc will be created in the root folder of Google Drive
   - Capture the returned document ID and link

4. **Find the next available row** in the tracking spreadsheet:
   - Use `mcp__google-workspace__read_sheet_values` with:
     - `user_google_email`: "david@david-peralta.com"
     - `spreadsheet_id`: "1VMNPMKCFG6an5UpteL5aUtm-VLgFgrSOFZDZE6h1ig8"
     - `range_name`: "Phase 2 Tracking!B:B"
   - Iterate through the returned values to find the first empty cell
   - The row number of the first empty cell is where we'll add our new entry

5. **Update the spreadsheet** with the new entry:
   - Use `mcp__google-workspace__modify_sheet_values` with:
     - `user_google_email`: "david@david-peralta.com"
     - `spreadsheet_id`: "1VMNPMKCFG6an5UpteL5aUtm-VLgFgrSOFZDZE6h1ig8"
     - `range_name`: `Phase 2 Tracking!B{row}:F{row}` where {row} is the next empty row number
     - `values`: [[keyword, "", "", doc_link, "Ready for Review"]]
     - Note: Columns C (MSV) and D (KD) are left empty as placeholders

6. **Provide feedback** to the user:
   - Confirm successful Google Doc creation with the document title
   - Display the Google Doc link with instructions to manually move it to the NPD drafts folder
   - Confirm spreadsheet update with the row number that was updated
   - Display the NPD drafts folder link for easy access: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JWFAoYKwsD2zTtypjs2gb34F0jAvv2bD
   - Report any errors encountered during the process

## Manual Steps After Completion
After the command completes successfully:
1. Click the provided Google Doc link
2. In Google Drive, move the document to the NPD drafts folder
3. The spreadsheet link will continue to work regardless of the document's folder location

## Error Handling
- If the file doesn't exist or can't be read, report: "Error: File not found at {path}"
- If the primary keyword can't be extracted, report: "Error: Could not extract primary keyword from line 3. Expected format: **Primary keyword:** [keyword]"
- If Google Doc creation fails, report the specific error from the API
- If spreadsheet update fails, report the error but note that the Google Doc was still created
- Always provide clear, actionable feedback about what succeeded or failed
