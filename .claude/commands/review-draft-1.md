# review-draft

Review generated SEO articles against all Seed requirements and offer to fix issues.

## Usage

- `/review-draft` - Reviews the most recent draft in /Generated-Drafts/
- `/review-draft filename.md` - Reviews a specific file
- `/review-draft melatonin` - Reviews draft containing keyword in filename

## What This Command Does

This command performs a comprehensive quality review of your generated draft, checking ~50 different requirements across 6 categories. It then offers to fix any issues found, either all at once or by category.

## Implementation

When this command runs:

1. **First, identify which file to review:**
   - If no argument provided: Find the most recent v1-*.md file across all subdirectories in `/Generated-Drafts/`
   - If argument looks like a filename: Use that specific file (search in subdirectories)
   - If argument is a keyword: Find the keyword folder in `/Generated-Drafts/[keyword]/` and use the latest version

2. **Load the draft and all reference documents:**
   - The draft to review
   - `/Reference/Compliance/NO-NO-WORDS.md`
   - `/Reference/Compliance/What-We-Are-Not-Allowed-To-Say.md`
   - `/Reference/Style/Seed-Tone-of-Voice-and-Structure.md`
   - `/Reference/Style/8-Sample-Reference-Blog-Articles.md`

3. **Run comprehensive checks across 6 categories:**

### üìä Citations & Evidence Checks
- Count total citations (must be exactly 12-15, no more, no less)
- Verify each citation format: `([Author Year](DOI_URL))` with NO comma between Author and Year
- Check that all citations have DOI links (must start with http or https)
- Calculate citation density (should be ~1 per 75-100 words for key claims, not for every statement)
- Verify citations are only for: specific studies, quantitative data, mechanisms, health claims, Seed positioning

### üè∑Ô∏è Product References Checks
- All NPD product mentions include ¬Æ symbol
- Correct format: `[PM-02¬Æ Sleep + Restore](https://seed.com/sleep-restore)`, `[AM-02¬Æ Energy + Focus](https://seed.com/energy-focus)`, `[DM-02¬Æ Daily Multivitamin](https://seed.com/daily-multivitamin)`
- Verify focus is on ingredient story, not product pitch (should explain WHY ingredients work, not just promote products)

### ‚öñÔ∏è Compliance Checks
- Scan entire text against NO-NO-WORDS list (case-insensitive)
- Check for "supplement" used specifically with probiotics (this is forbidden)
- Flag medical claims: treat, cure, diagnose, prevent, boost, heal, fix
