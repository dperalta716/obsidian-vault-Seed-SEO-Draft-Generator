# review-draft-seed-perspective

Review generated SEO articles against **Seed's scientific perspective ONLY** (Claims docs, NPD Messaging, SciComms). Run this FIRST before quality checks.

## Usage

- `/review-draft-seed-perspective` - Reviews the most recent draft in /Generated-Drafts/
- `/review-draft-seed-perspective filename.md` - Reviews a specific file
- `/review-draft-seed-perspective keyword` - Reviews draft containing keyword in filename

## What This Command Does

This command grades articles against **Seed's scientific perspective** across 3 categories:
1. **Claims Document Usage** (5 checks) - Uses our pre-approved sources as primary authority
2. **NPD Messaging Alignment** (5 checks) - Reflects product-specific positioning
3. **SciComms Education Integration** (5 checks) - Incorporates relevant educational content

**Total: 15 checks → Letter Grade (A-F)**

## When to Use This

**Run FIRST to verify Seed perspective**, then run `/review-draft-1` for quality/compliance checks.

```
Workflow:
1. /review-draft-seed-perspective → Grade Seed alignment (A-F)
2. If Grade A-B → /review-draft-1 for quality polish
3. If Grade C-F → Fix Seed issues first, then quality check
```

## What This Command Does NOT Check

- Citation formatting
- Tone of voice
- Compliance with NO-NO words
- Article structure
- SEO elements

(Use `/review-draft-1` for these checks)

## Implementation

### STEP 1: File Identification

Identify which file to review:
- If no argument: Find most recent v1-*.md file in `/Generated-Drafts/` subdirectories
- If argument looks like filename: Use that specific file
- If argument is keyword: Find keyword folder and use latest version

### STEP 2: Product Auto-Detection

**Scan the article to determine which product it covers:**

1. **Look for explicit product mentions:**
   - PM-02® or "Sleep + Restore" → PM-02
   - DM-02® or "Daily Multivitamin" → DM-02
   - AM-02® or "Energy + Focus" → AM-02

2. **Check for product-specific ingredients:**
   - Melatonin → PM-02
   - Multivitamin, comprehensive vitamins/minerals → DM-02
   - Energy, mitochondrial function, nootropics → AM-02

3. **Analyze keyword patterns:**
   - "sleep", "circadian", "melatonin" → PM-02
   - "multivitamin", "nutrient gaps", "daily vitamin" → DM-02
   - "energy", "focus", "cognitive", "mitochondria" → AM-02

4. **If multiple products detected:** Choose primary focus based on keyword and main content
5. **If unclear:** Default to checking all three products and note this in output

**Load appropriate reference files based on detected product:**
- `/Reference/Claims/[PRODUCT]/[PRODUCT]-General-Claims.md`
- `/Reference/Claims/[PRODUCT]/[PRODUCT]-*-Claims.md` (all ingredient-specific files)
- `/Reference/NPD-Messaging/[PRODUCT] Product Messaging Reference Documents.md`
- `/Reference/SciComms Education Files/[PRODUCT] SciComms [Topic] Education.md`

### STEP 3: Relevance Analysis (KEY INNOVATION)

**Before grading, analyze which SciComms content is actually relevant to THIS article:**

1. **Read the article's:**
   - Primary keyword
   - H2/H3 structure
   - Main topics covered
   - Specific ingredients discussed

2. **Identify relevant SciComms sections:**
   - Read through the SciComms Education file for detected product
   - Determine which talking points, narratives, and claims apply to THIS specific article
   - Flag sections that are relevant vs. those that would be bloat

3. **Create a relevance map:**
   ```
   Relevant SciComms Sections:
   - "Why Should you Take a Multivitamin with Microbiome Support" → Highly relevant
   - "The Gut-Nutrition Connection" → Relevant
   - "Nutrient Deficiencies And Inadequacies" → Highly relevant
   - Deep CoQ10 mechanism details → Not relevant for overview article
   ```

**Relevance Criteria:**
- **Highly relevant:** Core to answering the article's primary keyword
- **Relevant:** Provides supporting context or Seed's unique angle
- **Not relevant:** Too detailed, off-topic, or would bloat the article

**IMPORTANT:** Only check for "Highly relevant" and "Relevant" content in subsequent grading. Do NOT flag missing content that's "Not relevant."

```

### STEP 6: Apply Fixes Based on User Response

Parse user's response and apply appropriate fixes:

**⚠️ CRITICAL: File Handling Protocol**

**BEFORE making ANY edits, you MUST:**
1. **First, create the new version file** (e.g., `v2-seed-perspective-reviewed.md`) by using the Write tool to copy the ENTIRE original content to the new file
2. **Make ALL edits to the new file ONLY** using the Edit tool on the new file path
3. **NEVER modify the original v1 file** - it must remain untouched

This ensures the original is always preserved and avoids needing to restore it later.

**For 'all' or 'critical' or specific categories:**

**Claims Document Integration:**
- Identify which Claims doc studies should be cited
- Replace or add citations with proper format: `([Author Year](DOI_URL))`
- Ensure Claims docs are primary authority (>50% of citations)
- Add missing health claims with proper attribution language ("DM-02 is formulated with...")
- **Preserve casual tone** when incorporating claims

**NPD Messaging Alignment:**
- **For DM-02:** Add soil depletion section, enhance microbiome-nutrition bidirectional discussion, add ViaCap® section, strengthen bioavailability examples, add critique of mega-dose multivitamins
- **For PM-02:** Add precision dosing explanation, enhance sleep-gut-brain axis, add dual-phase release section, add high-dose melatonin critique, emphasize "not overloading" philosophy
- **For AM-02:** Emphasize sustained vs. stimulant energy, enhance gut-mitochondria axis, strengthen cellular energy focus, add nootropic benefits, add stimulant product critique

**SciComms Integration:**
- Add relevant talking points from SciComms file (only those marked relevant in Step 3)
- Incorporate applicable narratives from "Expanded Content Guide"
- Add citations from SciComms docs where appropriate
- Adjust Dirk Gevers quote if needed to better align with Seed's perspective

### STEP 7: Save Reviewed Version

1. **Determine next version number:**
   - If reviewing v1-[name].md → save as v2-seed-perspective-reviewed.md
   - If reviewing v2-[name].md → save as v3-seed-perspective-reviewed.md
   - etc.

2. **Save in same keyword subfolder as original**

3. **Show summary with COPY-PASTE READY next command:**
   ```
   ✅ Seed Perspective Review complete!

   Grade: B (Good foundation - minor gaps addressed)

   Saved as: v2-seed-perspective-reviewed.md

   Changes applied:
   - Claims: Added 7 Citations from DM-02-General-Claims.md
   - Messaging: Added soil depletion narrative and ViaCap® section
   - SciComms: Incorporated relevant nutrient deficiency statistics

   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
   📝 NEXT STEP (copy and paste this command):
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

   /review-draft-1-v2 [FULL_PATH_TO_V2_FILE]

   Example:
   /review-draft-1-v2 Seed-SEO-Draft-Generator-v4/Generated-Drafts/049-kava-vs-ashwagandha/v2-seed-perspective-reviewed.md
   ```

   **IMPORTANT:** The next step command MUST include:
   - The correct review command (`/review-draft-1-v2`)
   - The FULL relative path from the vault root to the v2 file that was just created
   - This allows the user to simply copy and paste the command without searching for the file

4. **Original file is NEVER modified** (edits only made to new v2 file per STEP 6 protocol)

## Important Notes

- **This command checks SEED PERSPECTIVE ONLY** - not quality, tone, or compliance
- **Run this FIRST** before `/review-draft-1-v2`
- **Check #3 preserves casual tone** - verifies substance of claims, not exact wording
- **Smart relevance detection** - only flags missing content that's relevant to the topic
- **Product detection is automatic** but may need manual verification
- **Grading is strict** - Grade A/B means Seed perspective is solid, proceed to quality review
- **Grade C or lower** - fix Seed issues before bothering with quality checks
- **NEVER modify the original file** - always create v2 copy FIRST, then edit only the copy
- **Version numbering includes "seed-perspective-reviewed"** to distinguish from quality reviews
- **Completion output includes copy-paste ready next command** with full file path

## Workflow Integration

```
Draft Generation → /review-draft-seed-perspective → Grade A/B? → /review-draft-1 → Done
                                                  ↓
                                               Grade C-F? → Fix & Re-review
```

**Why This Workflow?**
- Catches fundamental Seed perspective issues first
- Avoids wasting time polishing tone/SEO if core perspective is wrong
- Keeps each command focused and non-bloated
- Two-step process ensures both Seed alignment AND quality
