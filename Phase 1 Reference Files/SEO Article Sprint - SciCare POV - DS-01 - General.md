SEO Article Sprint - SciCare POV
Requested by: Kate Carruth
Owner: Dana Jessen-Howard
Description:
We are looking for the Seed POV on common topics that has a strong perspective rooted in literature, but also has the Seed perspective woven in (a great example: when is the best time of day to take a probiotic? I know the literature is somewhat inconclusive but generally recommends taking probiotics in the morning; however I also know that the Seed POV might include that, but also say “it’s important to find a time that you can take DS-01 consistently, rather than stressing too much over taking it in the AM” or something along those lines). This will help us train our editor(s) on the general Seed perspective (which sometimes has its own nuance from the wider body of research) while helping us develop a large batch of SEO optimized articles.
See below for a list of 95 article titles we will be writing; can you pull SciCare macros that you think could help contribute to the development of the articles? I have included columns for Macros, Citations, and Notes but please don't feel like you need to fill in every single column for every single topic; it's just added there for ease if you want to use it that way!
First 95 article titles (could potentially shift around in priority): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BI1FH3MAYCy_Nnl4MpvUsxTSzwMqOMiozFKgKrhVb7U/edit?usp=sharing
1. Best time to take probiotics


[Care macro - basic / intro]: when should I take DS01?
[ONLY TO INCLUDE IF MEMBER SAW/REFERRED TO REC ON PACKAGING, WHICH HAS NOT YET BEEN UPDATED: We generally recommend taking DS-01® Daily Synbiotic on an empty stomach.] That said, if it’s more comfortable for you to take DS-01® before/after a meal or alongside food, we encourage you to choose the best method for you. Rest assured DS-01® works well in both fed and fasted states.
As far as daily timing, there is no universal best time of day to take DS-01®, so we suggest finding a time that works best for your body and routine. The most important thing is continuous daily intake.
Why is it recommended to take DS on an empty stomach? Can I take DS with food?


[Note for Specialists (this paragraph is not intended for members): Effectiveness of a probiotic is not the same as viability of probiotic strains, but they are related. Viability equates to the strains being alive (which we test for with SHIME®), while effectiveness directly relates to the product’s ability to demonstrate the strain-specific benefits (which we back with our strain-specific benefits studies (on a strain level) as well as our clinical trials (on a product level)).
Now, it is important to understand how the two are linked: live probiotics that reach the target site have higher metabolic potential and therefore can perform a more broad spectrum of activity. But live does not necessarily mean efficacious as there are many types of -biotics (heat-killed, postbiotics, tyndallized) that demonstrate benefits in clinical trials without being alive.]
Can I take with food?
Taking DS-01® Daily Synbiotic on a full stomach should not significantly impact the viability of the probiotic strains.
For context, when testing our proprietary 2-in-1 capsule, ViaCap®, in the Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME®), both the fasted and fed conditions resulted in physiologically relevant and comparable numbers of live cells delivered at the end of the small intestine. This in mind, it would be perfectly fine to take DS-01® however you feel is most comfortable—the most important factor is consistent daily intake.
Why do you recommend these dosing instructions?
For context, when you consume food or a meal, your body begins to up-regulate gastric acid and digestive enzymes which are known to damage or impair the viability of most probiotic organisms.
That said, we've tested DS-01® Daily Synbiotic in a simulated in vitro model of the human gastrointestinal system (SHIME®)—recent results indicate that DS-01® performs well both in fasted (no food) and fed (after food) states.
Therefore, as every body is physiologically unique, we always suggest each individual experiment with the method of intake that works best for them and is most easily tolerated by their body. The most important factor is consistent daily intake.
[OPTIONAL ADD ON if additional information is requested surrounding timing:
Gastric emptying rate (the speed with which substances leave the stomach after ingestion) varies depending on multiple factors—including the type, consistency, and quality of food, in addition to unique health + physiology states—therefore, it is difficult to make specific recommendations as it relates to mealtime and simultaneous probiotic consumption.
With this in mind, we always suggest each individual experiment with the method of intake that works best for them and is most easily tolerated by their body.]
[OPTIONAL ADD-ON if the member comments on packaging recommendation to take fasted: We are currently working on a packaging update to best reflect this exciting data. ]
Is There a Recommended Waiting Period Before Eating After Taking Capsules?
To clarify, there isn't a specific recommended waiting period before eating after taking the capsules.
For some context, the gastric emptying rate (speed with which substances leave the stomach after ingestion) varies depending on multiple factors—including the type, consistency, and quality of food, in addition to unique health + physiology states.
Therefore, it is difficult to make specific recommendations as it relates to mealtime and simultaneous probiotic consumption.
Rest assured, we've tested DS-01® in a simulated in vitro model of the human gastrointestinal system (SHIME®)—recent results indicate that DS-01® performs well both in fasted (no food) and fed (after food) states.
With this in mind, we always suggest each individual experiment with the method of intake that works best for them and is most easily tolerated by their body 🌱
Why is DS-01® recommended to be consumed on an empty stomach, while PDS-08® is recommended on a full stomach?


It is important to note that these data suggest a different mode of consumption compared to PDS-08® Pediatric Daily Synbiotic, which we recommend taking with a food or beverage. This disparity is the result of different delivery technologies: the free flowing powder in PDS-08® which leverages microencapsulation technology, versus our proprietary capsule-in-capsule delivery technology, ViaCap®, in DS-01®.
For DS-01®, the testing of ViaCap® indicated high levels of protection under both fasted and fed states, allowing the capsule to move quickly past the harsh conditions of the stomach. Individual comfort level when taking supplements on an empty stomach may vary, and you know your body best, so we advise you to experiment and follow what feels best for your particular ecosystem.
[ONLY USE IF NECESSARY: While the ViaCap® effectively protects strains against the acidic stomach, it can only do so for a limited time, and ingested items usually remain in the stomach longer during active digestion (whereas they pass through faster when it’s empty). Thus by taking DS-01® on an empty stomach, you enable the capsule to pass through the highly acidic environment of the stomach and reach the acid-protected environment of the small intestine—where the fragile bacteria will then begin release on their journey to the colon. ]
In contrast, because the powdered formulation of PDS-08® contains select microencapsulated strains which do not have a protective capsule, it exhibited a much higher survivability rate in a fed state, likely because of the buffer that a meal/food provides against the acidic conditions of the stomach.
This in mind, different delivery forms resulted in varying probiotic survivability rates, hence the contrasting recommendations for DS-01® and PDS-08® intake. 
Does DS survive digestion
Most probiotics don’t survive the trip through your gut. To address this, we’ve designed DS-01® Daily Synbiotic capsule to safeguard bacteria through digestion. Our patented delivery technology, ViaCap®, nests our probiotic strains in a vegan inner capsule, contained inside a chlorophyllin outer capsule which also houses the solubilized blend of the prebiotic compounds. The outer capsule acts as an elegant barrier to oxygen, moisture, and heat to safeguard and ensure the viability of the probiotic inner capsule.
To test how this design supports survivability, we tested DS-01® in the Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME®)—the premier simulated human intestinal microbial ecosystem assessment tool. [OPTIONAL ADD-ON SENTENCE: This system recreates the physiological conditions and biological processes representative of the human gastrointestinal tract, controlling for temperature and pH.] ViaCap® was able to withstand the harmful pH of the stomach, and enable precision delivery of viable cells at the end of the simulated ileum (small intestine) for delivery to the colon.
Our patented capsule-in-capsule ViaCap® technology provides over 50X viable cells at the target site compared to the industry standard. 


Note Kate Carruth: stopping here with macros for this one, but if you’d like more on specific interactions between medications and DS, acidity of certain drinks compared to probiotic research, or any other more specifics that may be related to some nuances of this question, just let me know—we have a lot more to go into here.


2. Signs that probiotics are working / How long does it take for probiotics to work 


When will I start to feel something? / I don't feel any different / No effects
Every individual’s body is unique, and, thus, everyone's experience with DS-01® Daily Synbiotic is also unique; therefore, there is no universally consistent timeline for effects felt. The benefits one may feel (ease of bloating, or easier more frequent poops, for example) are often just the most visceral ones. Some individuals experience effects shortly after use due to localized benefits like improved digestion, while this may take a few weeks for others, as your body uniquely adjusts to the potent probiotic strains in DS-01®. In fact, some individuals even experience a temporary acclimation period—where their bowel movements become slightly more irregular for a few weeks while their body adjusts, before normalizing and become more regular—while others may not.
Further, it can also be important to note that our biochemical pathways are constantly at work even though we may not necessarily feel their direct effects—there are dozens of beneficial interactions that can take place between probiotics, prebiotics, and our own collection of cells that you may not necessarily feel, even though they contribute to better overall health. [OPTIONAL ADD ON: regarding SCFAs example: For example, the intestinal production of short chain fatty acids, or the increase in activity of cells which strengthen the gut barrier.] [OPTIONAL ADD ON: regarding alternate B12 example: For example, strains in DS-01® have been studied to support inflammatory pathways and contribute to healthy immune function, while other strains have been studied to support the production of essential micronutrients like vitamins B12 and folate—all outcomes which you may not necessarily feel.]
All said, positive changes in one area can often trigger systemic improvements in overall health––this is the hallmark of an ecosystem, and the basis of our approach. Thus, as long as daily intake is continued, rest assured those beneficial microbes are doing their work inside, to program, sustain, and enhance your health, even though you may not necessarily feel these effects immediately.]
[OPTIONAL ADD ON if member is dissatisfied with experience: With this said, once again, due to the uniqueness of human physiology and each individual's microbial mosaic, responses to probiotics can and do vary. Ultimately, you are the expert of your body and the decision to continue [DS-01® / PDS-08®] use is up to you, potentially made in conjunction with your healthcare provider's advice.]
How long should I take DS for
The length of time for which you take DS-01® Daily Synbiotic is completely up to you and/or the discretion of your healthcare provider.
In making this decision, do note that most research demonstrates that the benefits conferred by probiotic organisms are confined to the duration of consumption, or shortly thereafter, due to the transient nature of these microbes. Therefore, if benefits are desired, continued intake is likely required. [This is why we discuss the importance of consistent, daily intake, and is the reason why we offer DS-01® on a subscription basis.]
Interestingly, compared to the tens of trillions of microbes already rooted in the intestinal tract, most probiotic supplements don’t contain enough new bacteria to significantly or permanently alter the composition of the existing microbiota.
Rather, probiotic organisms work by traveling through the digestive tract to your colon, interacting with immune and gut cells, dietary nutrients, and existing bacteria along the way to enact benefits in your body, before being expelled in the stool. (This is in contrast to colonization of the gut, which, outside of specific circumstances such as a fecal microbiota transplant (FMT), probiotics are not known to do.)
Ultimately, this indicates that, as long as the benefits you desire from a supplement such as DS-01® do not change, the research does not indicate a need to take a break from your probiotic supplement.

microbiome impact + disruption overview
Research indicates that the health of your gut microbiome is critical not only to your digestive health, but to the health of most of your body—the gut microbiome has been connected to almost all components of your body. From your skin to your heart, from your immune system to your brain, a healthy gut microbiome is a major key in systemic health, and dysbiosis (disruption) of the gut microbiome has been shown to be connected to many systemic diseases.
Unfortunately, a variety of factors associated with modern living may disturb the balance of your gut microbiome—including antibiotic overuse, alcohol, tobacco, disrupted sleep, stress, and poor diet, among others. These factors may encourage microbial dysbiosis, leading to poor health outcomes.
And while it is certainly true that dietary intervention has been shown to have beneficial effects for both developing and maintaining a diverse or ‘healthy’ microbiome, sometimes your microbiome may require a little extra support!
That’s where probiotics such as DS-01® Daily Synbiotic come in, as they can provide support for your gut microbiome in a variety of ways–for example, by producing beneficial metabolites, like short chain fatty acids, or supporting gut barrier integrity.
Thus, while we do not believe health is contained in a single pill or supplement, we do believe that probiotics and prebiotics—alongside important lifestyle factors such as nutrition, exercise and sleep—can support your gut microbiome to achieve foundational, systemic health.
GALT / Gut Barrier Integrity / SCFAs
Fun fact—Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT) is known as the “largest immune organ” in the body as it represents about 70% of the entire immune system! This interplay between the immune system and the gut is known as the 'gut-immune axis'. And at the interface of this interaction is the gut barrier—a critical barrier that acts as the “first line” of defense, as it separates the “external” environment–containing commensal or pathogenic microorganisms–from the “internal” environment, which contains the intestinal epithelial cells. A breach in this barrier can lead to unfavorable bacteria passing through, potentially leading to systemic inflammation.
More generally, gut microbiota-derived metabolites are major factors in the gut-systemic health interplay. In particular, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are molecules produced from fermentation of non-digestible carbohydrates (mostly plant fiber). SCFAs are fuel for colon cells and integral in maintaining an intact gut barrier. SCFAs not only are involved in maintaining gut health, a reduction in SCFAs have been associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma due to their anti-inflammatory properties.
What is the research showing that probiotics support/benefit the gut? / 'Probiotic Skeptic' 
Condition-related Studies
Several probiotic strains have demonstrated beneficial use in both clinical settings and healthy individuals in recent years. In fact, per the American College of Gastroenterology, there are many gastrointestinal conditions in which scientific evidence has observed certain probiotic strains to serve as valuable tools—such as in Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Antibiotic Associated Diarrhea (AAD), Infectious Diarrhea, Ulcerative Colitis (UC), and Pouchitis.
Specifically, in terms of the clinical landscape of populations with digestive challenges, research suggests that probiotics may alleviate the frequency and severity of flatulence, support bowel movement regularity, improve stool consistency, and aid a better overall quality of life.
Additionally, during and after antibiotic use is often considered a good time for probiotics, as numerous studies have shown their ability to mitigate GI distress—such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults and children, and to promote the resilience of a healthy gut microbiome following antibiotic therapy.
To note however, as the field stands, it is inconclusive​ whether probiotics can be an effective therapeutic or intervention strategy for all conditions under the umbrella of IBD. While there are studies examining probiotics in the context of IBD (or specifically in the clinical subtypes, ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease), the majority of studies have been conducted in vitro—either in cells or in animal models. This urges the need for clinical trials in humans to better understand the efficacy of probiotics in managing IBD.
For example, although under the umbrella of IBD, Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) do not present the same—and thus, respond differently to the same treatment. One meta-analysis​ examining clinical trials using probiotics for UC, pouchitis, and CD patients indicated that while probiotics were beneficial for maintaining remission in UC and pouchitis patients, the same benefit was not seen in CD patients.
Therefore, while probiotics are generally safe as an adjunct therapy​ in the management of IBD, there is still a need for large samples of high-quality clinical trials to further determine the efficacy and strain-specific utility of probiotic agents in the induction and maintenance of various IBD subtypes.
It is important to draw attention to the fact that benefits for probiotic organisms are strain-specific. This is because benefits are clinically assessed and demonstrated at the strain level; and, due to the significant variance between strains, this data cannot simply be applied beyond the specific strain(s) studied.
This goes to show that more robust scientific studies are necessary to further evaluate the efficacy of specific probiotic strains in various health conditions.
[If the member mentions DS-01® or refers to our product(s): All said, it’s important to note that DS-01® Daily Synbiotic is regulated by the FDA as a dietary supplement, and as such, is not intended to treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition.]
DS-01®-specific ADD-ons
Zooming into product-specific benefits, we recently completed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial at Harvard Medical School evaluating the impact of DS-01® Daily Synbiotic on the microbiome of individuals with occasional digestive issues. Findings showed that DS-01® promotes growth of beneficial bacteria (Bifidobacterium and Lactobacilli)—supporting over 400% population growth of health-promoting gut microbes in those with mixed digestive challenges—compared to placebo. Further, DS-01® significantly improved abdominal discomfort and several markers of occasional constipation (BM frequency and stool hardness). Finally, this study showed DS-01® is clinically validated to promote a balanced inflammatory response in individuals with sporadic digestive disturbances.
Notably, administration of DS-01® increased serum (blood) serotonin—a key molecule for digestive motility and sensation—among participants, which suggests a potential mechanism of action for improvement in digestive symptoms.
Additionally, we recently completed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial under Health Canada evaluating the impact of DS-01® on the microbiome of individuals experiencing occasional gut stress. Findings showed that DS-01® significantly improved gut microbiome composition during temporary GI perturbations and enriched beneficial bacteria in the gut compared to placebo.
For more findings from our clinical trials, you may find our published abstracts here: Napier et al. Gastroenterology;166(5)S-1165, and Napier et al. Gastroenterology;166(5)S-1164﻿
Overall, DS-01® is formulated with 24 select strains which have been shown in clinical and scientific studies to support benefits for gastrointestinal function, gut barrier integrity, cardiovascular health, gut immune function, gut microbial balance, gut metabolite balance, micronutrient synthesis and dermatological health.
In addition to our finished product human clinical trials, our strains have been studied in over 20 pre-clinical (in vitro/mechanistic) and clinical (human) studies combined. You may view the studies by each benefit in addition to exploring more of the science behind our product here: seed.com/reference.
That all said, although probiotics are promising, there is much scientific evidence needing to be uncovered to warrant strain-specific claims for various health benefits.
This in mind, it may be helpful to identify what benefits matter to you and then search for transparent companies with the evidence and data-generation plans supporting their product claims. In addition, it is imperative to also look for products scientifically shown to withstand the shipping, storage, and digestive environments that can negatively impact the viability of bacteria.
For more information, you can find a helpful summary on choosing a probiotic in our Cultured article, Probiotics 101: seed.com/cultured/probiotics-101/﻿
Ultimately, if you have any questions about whether a probiotic supplement is right for you, it's best to work with a healthcare provider who can advise on product utility based on the unique benefits you desire and with the knowledge of your personal health history.
DS Benefits - Digestive 
Digestive Health
DS-01® Daily Synbiotic is formulated to support multiple markers of digestive health to reinforce a healthy overall gastrointestinal system. For example, research demonstrates strains in DS-01® promote healthy regularity, ease of occasional digestive discomforts, improvement in intestinal environment, and a balanced gut microbiome.
Constipation / Irregularity
When creating the formulation for DS-01® Daily Synbiotic, a primary feature we were looking for during the strain selection process was the capacity to ease occasional constipation.
In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of the strains L. plantarum LP01, B. breve BR03, and B. animalis subsp. lactis BS01, study participants who received the probiotic treatment reported a significant improvement in number of weekly bowel movements, consistency of feces, and ease of expulsion.
Further, administration of the strain B. longum BB536 to participants in another study resulted in improvements in intestinal environment, defecation frequency, and fecal characteristics (translation: easier, healthier, more regular poops).
DS Benefits - Dermatological
[DS-01® is formulated to support healthy skin and enhance skin appearance and quality / DS-01® includes strains that contribute to improved skin appearance, and help maintain a balanced relationship between gut and skin health / DS-01® is formulated to nourish the skin from the inside out], by way of the gut-skin axis (the bidirectional relationship between the gut microbiome and skin health).
In addition, the novel prebiotic contained in DS-01® sourced from Indian pomegranate, has been clinically tested and shown to help maintain healthy skin and support a balanced skin microbiome through the gut-skin-axis.
Alternate Version for scientific elaboration:
The main mechanism that we propose for DS-01® Daily Synbiotic’s potential to support healthy, clear-looking skin is by way of the gut-skin axis. For example, two strains in DS-01®—Ligilactobacillus salivarius SD-LS1-IT and Bifidobacterium breve BR03—have been shown in a randomized controlled trial to significantly improve clinical and immunological parameters from baseline in a population of adults with troublesome skin. The clinical parameters improved by the probiotics were measured by reduced microbial translocation and immune activation, as well as improved T-helper cell (Th)17/regulatory T cell (Treg) ratios, and Th1/Th2 ratios.
DS Benefits - Cardiovascular
Several strains included in DS-01® Daily Synbiotic were selected for their ability to support cardiovascular health through the modulation of plasma lipids and cholesterol.
For example, L. plantarum SD- LDL400-UK was chosen specifically because it has clinically demonstrated the ability to help support healthy cholesterol levels (already in a normal range) in humans. In a 12-week double-blind, randomized controlled trial with healthy participants, probiotic participants maintained normal LDL-C baseline levels, while those in the placebo group experienced an increase in LDL-C.
[OPTIONAL ADD-ON for an additional example above: In addition, another strain in DS-01®, Bifidobacterium lactis SD-MB2409-IT, has been shown mechanistically to exhibit high bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity in vitro. BSH produced by intestinal bacteria catalyzes deconjugation and metabolism of bile acids in the small intestine. This is important for cardiovascular health as BSH participates in a range of metabolic processes including the regulation of dietary lipid absorption, cholesterol metabolism, energy levels, and inflammation homeostasis (or balance of inflammatory processes in the body).]
Finally, though certain DS-01® strains have been shown to support heart health in various ways, note that DS-01® is not intended to treat, prevent or cure any cardiovascular disease state or condition, nor is this supplement intended to replace any existing or new medical regimen used to treat cardiovascular disease. It is always best to speak with a doctor when considering a probiotic in the context of any health concerns.
[Extra add-on: Many factors are associated with overall cardiovascular health, but growing evidence indicates that the intestinal microbiome plays a role through a variety of mechanisms. Thus, the therapeutic potential of probiotics in influencing heart health has received attention in the scientific literature.]
DS Benefits - Gut Barrier Integrity
When building our strain bank, gut barrier integrity was one of the primary features considered—DS-01® is formulated with strains that help reinforce gut-barrier function and maintain integrity of the intestinal barrier. In fact, several of our strains have been studied to promote healthy tight junction expression (in vitro). Tight junctions are essential for establishing our gut-barrier and regulating flow of substances to prevent gut ‘leakiness’.
In addition, several of our strains were shown mechanistically (in vitro) to increase production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are byproducts that come as a result of carbohydrate fermentation. Finally, a study showed that DS-01® [may support the production of SCFAs / increased buyrate production by 29.7% and acetate by 18.6%] in vitro. [Optional: SCFAs can help to maintain a healthy gut intestinal environment and act as fuel for our colon cells.]
A caveat with in vitro testing, however, is that, despite the ability to produce efficient preliminary results, these studies often fail to replicate the conditions of a human body. And as a company rooted in science, we often inform our members of the potential inability of in vitro results to replicate in real world conditions.
Research option: Probiotics + Leaky Gut / Intestinal Integrity
Version 1 (summary / most simple)
Intestinal integrity was one of the primary features we considered in building our strain bank—in fact, in the early phases of our product formulation, our researchers noted that several of our strains promoted increased expression of a gene called Nrf2, in vitro. This gene is implicated in gut-barrier integrity.
Nrf2 is crucial to the upkeep of organ systems that often deal with environmental insults, such as the liver and intestine. With increased expression, this gene can “clean up” reactive oxygen species (ROS), compounds that are responsible for injury to the gut mucosal lining. In addition, Nrf2 expression is associated with the production of proteins in the gut that form ‘tight junctions.’ As their name implies, tight junctions form scaffolding in the gut barrier to reinforce its’ integrity and keep out foreign materials and contaminants.
In addition, several of our strains were shown in vitro to increase production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), byproducts that come as a result of carbohydrate fermentation. SCFAs also maintain a healthy gut intestinal environment and gut-barrier integrity. A caveat with in vitro testing, however, is that, despite the ability to produce efficient preliminary results, these studies often fail to replicate the conditions of a human body. And as a company rooted in science, we often inform our members of the potential inability of in vitro results to replicate in real world conditions.
Further, our probiotic strains are not the only component of our product working towards maintaining a healthy gut barrier. We included a special extract from Indian pomegranate—called punicalagins—that interact with species of microbes in the gut. When consumed by gut microbes, punicalagins are transformed into urolithins, a powerful class of molecules that have been associated with decreased proinflammatory immune cell expression, lower levels of colon tissue damage, and increased production of colonic tight junction proteins.
﻿
[ Additional information if asking about how Leaky Gut is diagnosed or measured: Assessing the presence of leaky gut can be done through stool zonulin testing, which is typically available through at-home and in-person lab testing. Diagnostic testing via blood/stool samples or standard questionnaires can be performed to identify potential markers such as high histamine, low DAO, and/or the presence of antibodies to intestinal cells; measuring immune activation to bacteria can be performed as well. For example, in clinical trials, researchers can use lactulose/mannitol testing to assess intestinal permeability in response to an intervention (probiotics). Lactulose absorption is said to represent gut damage (mucosal integrity) and mannitol absorption is used as a measure of normal small intestine function (nutrient uptake).
However, identifying the impact of probiotics specifically on the progression of leaky gut can be challenging and involve additional primary or clinical endpoints. (Insert relevant information from How do probiotic benefits show up in lab results?)
While there are blood tests that indicate the presence of leaky gut, causes are multifactorial and the progression of this condition may need to be monitored more holistically through multiple clinical endpoints. ]
Version 2 (deeper explanation)
(add-on to above) How can i improve gut barrier integrity (non-probiotic)?
Aside from probiotics, I would like to share some information from scientific literature on potential ways to improve gut barrier integrity.
Unsurprisingly, diet plays a large factor on gut barrier function. One study​ found the Mediterranean diet​ affected barrier function genes, suggesting this diet may play a beneficial role in improving barrier function—most likely due to SCFAs. A similar study​ found a diet higher in Omega-3 polyunsaturated fats (such as those found in seafood and nuts) led to an increase in barrier function, while a diet higher in saturated fats (such as in fast food) led to an increase in barrier dysfunction.
Further, dietary carbohydrates ​(sugars) can play a major role on the gut barrier. Fiber​, on one hand, promotes a stronger barrier function by allowing for bacterial fermentation to create SCFAs and also for increasing the mucus layer​ to prevent pathogens from reaching the gut barrier. On the other hand, fructose​ is a known disruptor of the gut barrier by affecting tight junction proteins. Therefore, modulating dietary factors and limiting barrier 'disruptors' could be a way to improve gut barrier integrity.
Other notable beneficial factors include partaking in moderate exercise​, increasing vitamin D levels​, and keeping to a regular eating time​ (i.e. not close to rest time). Reduced gut barrier integrity is also associated with certain conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease​, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, anxiety/depression​, NSAID-induced damage—therefore, it may be pertinent to discuss with your healthcare provider to assess the potential causes and treatments to improve your gut barrier integrity.
DS Benefits - Micronutrient Synthesis
﻿Select strains in our DS-01® Daily Synbiotic may support an increase in the production of the essential micronutrient folate, and may produce biologically relevant levels of vitamin B12 based on in vitro studies.
For additional context, a strain in DS-01®, Bifidobacterium adolescentis SD-BA5-IT (known in the literature as B. adolescentis DSM 18350), can metabolize B vitamins found in their natural form (think: folate in leafy greens) into a form that is useable by the human host, known as folic acid. In so doing, the strains included in our product may support uptake of this essential micronutrient.
Similarly, Limosilactobacillus reuteri SD-LRE2-IT, another strain in our formula, has been evaluated in in vitro conditions to produce vitamin B12—a process that cannot be performed by plants or animals independently. It is important to note that, while the results from this study have only been demonstrated in "test tube" models to date, L. reuteri SD-LRE2-IT shows promise of surviving throughout GI transit for arrival to the ileum (the area of the intestines where B12 is absorbed). Thus, our researchers plan to conduct further studies aimed to assess and validate DS-01®'s ability to positively improve vitamin B12 status in humans.
DS-01® Relationship to folate/b12

In so doing, these strains may support uptake of this essential micronutrient.
If asking if DS-01® can replace their b12 and folate supplements?
To clarify, DS-01® is not formulated with B12 or folate. For reference, you can view our complete strain and ingredient list here​.
[insert relevant verbiage from above]
Regarding whether you should continue taking your B vitamins, of note, we do not know for certain the amount of B12 or folate that may be conferred by taking DS-01®, and thus we can't say for sure whether it would be sufficient to replace your current B vitamin intake.
This in mind, I can share that there are no known contraindications between probiotics and other dietary supplements; therefore, DS-01® should be fine to combine with supplements, such as B12 and folate.
All said, we would suggest consulting with your health care provider if you have any specific questions relating to DS-01® use in the context of your current supplement routine.
[OPTIONAL if concerned about safety / having excess B vitamins—For some reassurance, B12 is water-soluble, and is generally considered safe​, even at high doses (as any excess is excreted in the urine). For folate​, the daily upper limit is 1,000 mcg for healthy adults.]
Anemia / Iron Deficiency
Kindly note that DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been examined in patients with [low iron levels / iron deficiency anemia/ in the context of iron absorption] ; thus, we cannot comment on effects in this regard. However, I'm glad to share information about this topic from scientific literature!
For some background, dietary iron is usually in the non-bioavailable (ferric) form, and needs to be converted to the bioavailable (ferrous) form in order to be used by cells. One possible mechanism for this involves reducing the pH from neutral to acidic to allow for the natural conversion​ from ferric to ferrous form.
﻿Lactic acid​ produced by lactic acid bacteria can help with this process through organic reduction of the pH necessary for the ferrous form, or by excreting molecules that help with the ferric to ferrous form conversion. Additionally, systemic inflammation is suspected of contributing to suboptimal iron uptake. Therefore, some you may find in probiotic products have been associated with increasing iron absorption, possibly through various mechanisms that influence anti-inflammatory responses, enhance iron uptake, or increase ferrous iron bioavailability.
All this in mind, based on scientific literature, probiotic bacteria may be more beneficial than harmful for iron deficiency; however, as mentioned above, more studies and trials are needed to properly establish the dosage, timing, and method of intake to conclusively determine if a strain confers beneficial effects—as benefits are strain-specific and dose dependent.

Additionally, other bacteria have been associated with increasing iron absorption. Lactobacillus plantarum 299v was noted to improve iron deficiency when given together with Vitamin C​, with a meal​, or with a rich source of iron like pearl millet​.

Interestingly, there is research​ suggesting that probiotic bacteria could help with the bioavailability of iron (i.e. how much iron is available in your body). Majority of the research regarding probiotics and iron bioavailability focus on lactic acid bacteria (LAB) such as the Lactobacillus species.
For some background, dietary iron is usually in the non-bioavailable (ferric) form, and needs to be converted to the bioavailable (ferrous) form in order to be used by cells. One possible mechanism for this involves reducing the pH from neutral to acidic to allow for the natural conversion​ from ferric to ferrous form.

Other molecules created by LAB can also help—for example, Lactobacillus fermentum​ has been studied to increase iron bioavailability by excreting a molecule that helps with the ferric to ferrous form conversion.
Additionally, one particular strain has been used in multiple studies conducted regarding iron-deficiency anemia (IDA). Lactobacillus plantarum 299v was noted to improve iron deficiency when given together with Vitamin C​, with a meal​, or with a rich source of iron like pearl millet​. A systematic review​ noted this strain may be able to increase iron absorption through various mechanisms that influence anti-inflammatory responses, enhancing iron uptake, or increasing ferrous iron bioavailability.
However, aside from L. plantarum 299v, other probiotic strains have not been thoroughly considered in clinical trials. Even with this strain, more studies and trials are needed to properly establish the dosage, timing, and method of intake to confer beneficial effects. Please note our synbiotic does not contain this specific strain—benefits are strain-specific and dose dependent!
All this in mind, based on scientific literature, probiotic bacteria may be more beneficial than harmful for iron deficiency; however, as mentioned above, more studies and trials are needed to properly establish the dosage, timing, and method of intake to conclusively determine if a strain confers beneficial effects—as benefits are strain-specific and dose dependent.
[OPTIONAL—if asked about vitamin B12/B9 + iron:
Vitamin B is essential for our health: it is known that the lack of Vitamin B​—Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) and B9 (folate) in particular—is associated with anemia. The human body itself cannot produce B12​ or B9, and needs to get these vitamins from either food or our gut bacteria. Probiotic bacteria, such as those in the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera, are known to be avid producers of vitamins, especially B vitamins​, and therefore, probiotic bacteria that produce these vitamins may help with anemia.
On a related note, the strain Bifidobacterium adolescentis SD-BA5-IT (also known in the literature as B. adolescentis DSM 18350), can metabolize B vitamins found in their natural form (think: folate in leafy greens) into a form that is usable by the human host, known as folic acid. In so doing, these strains may support uptake of this essential micronutrient.
Similarly, another strain—Limosilactobacillus reuteri SD-LRE2-IT—has been shown in in vitro conditions to produce vitamin B12—a process that cannot be performed by plants or animals independently. However, it is important to note that the results from this study have only been demonstrated in "test tube" models to date. However, our proprietary capsule-in-capsule delivery technology, ViaCap®, shows promise of enabling strains to survive throughout GI transit for arrival to the ileum (the area of the intestines where B12 is absorbed).
Of note, further studies will be helpful to assess and validate probiotic impact on vitamin B12 status in humans. ]


DS Benefits - Gut Immune Function
DS-01® Daily Synbiotic is formulated to reinforce healthy immune responses, support the body’s natural defense mechanisms and maintain healthy levels of inflammation for a resilient immune system.
Certain strains (Ligilactobacillus salivarius SD-LS1-IT and Bifidobacterium breve SD-BR3-IT) in our product have been studied for their ability to support immune tolerance through a balancing of inflammatory cytokines (signaling proteins that help control inflammation in your body).
[optional add on for HCPs/nerdiest-level] The results of the referenced study suggest that probiotic intervention has various effects on gut-immune interactions. Such effects could include reduced plasma LPS concentration, decreased activated T lymphocytes, the expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs), balance of Th1, Th2, and Th17 T-cell subsets, and influence on the ratios between these subsets. Overall, the findings imply that select strains in DS-01® could help to reinforce gut barrier integrity, support immune tolerance, and maintain regulated immune responses. 


DS Benefits - Gut Metabolite Balance


DS-01® supports the production of beneficial gut metabolites in vitro, such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are byproducts that come as a result of carbohydrate fermentation. SCFAs can help maintain a healthy gut intestinal environment and fuel our colon cells. [Optional: Specifically, a mechanistic (in vitro) study showed increased production of buyrate by 29.7% and of acetate by 18.6%]. In addition, several of our strains were shown in vitro to increase production of SCFAs.
Additionally, our capsules contain strains which have been shown to [degrade undesirable dietary compounds / aid in healthy gut metabolite balance during times of stress / support the production of glutathione (a potent antioxidant that helps protect cells from oxidative damage) / restore microbial balance when exposed to environmental stressors].
A caveat with in vitro testing, however, is that, despite the ability to produce efficient preliminary results, these studies often fail to replicate the conditions of a human body. And as a company rooted in science, we often inform our members of the potential inability of in vitro results to replicate in real world conditions.


What is the science behind the benefits of DS?
Overall Science
To start, DS-01® is formulated with 24 select strains which have been shown in clinical and scientific studies to support benefits for gastrointestinal function, gut barrier integrity, cardiovascular health, gut immune function, gut microbial balance, gut metabolite balance, micronutrient synthesis and dermatological health.
Our strains have been studied in over 20 pre-clinical (in vitro/mechanistic) and clinical (human) studies combined. You may view the studies by each benefit in addition to exploring more of the science behind our product here: seed.com/reference.
On a related note, we recently completed two double-blind, randomized controlled trials on DS-01®. The first trial was conducted at Harvard Medical School - Beth Israel Deaconess to assess the clinical effects of our Daily Synbiotic in persons with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS); and the second, under Health Canada approval, studied our Daily Synbiotic and its impact on post-antibiotic recovery.
For some progress updates: both clinical trials are complete and we are currently in the process of manuscript review. We expect results to be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal by late 2024, and we will be sharing the results with our ecosystem soon. If interested, you may find progress on both the Health Canada trial, and the Harvard Medical School trial on ClinicalTrials.gov.
Overall Benefits

Strain-specific benefit studies
The probiotic strains in DS-01® Daily Synbiotic have been clinically and scientifically studied in over 20 preclinical (in vitro / mechanistic) and clinical (human) studies combined, to support digestive health and beyond–including gut barrier integrity, cardiovascular health, gut immune function, micronutrient synthesis, gut microbial and metabolite balance, and dermatological health. You may access a full list of our strain-specific benefit studies on the product References page of our website, here.
The studies we reference therein represent the exact strains in our product, and our proprietary formulation ensures all strains are included in the same dosage as their respective studies.
﻿tell me about your product clinical trials
We recently completed two double-blind, randomized controlled trials on our finished product, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic.
The first trial was conducted at Harvard Medical School - Beth Israel Deaconess, and aimed to assess the clinical effects of DS-01® in persons with occasional digestive issues, while our second one, under Health Canada approval, studied DS-01®'s impact on individuals with temporary GI perturbations.
We're excited to share that administration of DS-01® significantly enriched Bifidobacterium spp. (460%, p=0.009) and lactobacilli (420%, p=0.003) at 84 days among study participants. For more findings from our clinical trials, you may find our published abstracts here: Napier et al. Gastroenterology;166(5)S-1165, and Napier et al.

Details about IBS trial
Version 1 (non-technical)
We recently completed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial at Harvard Medical School evaluating the impact of DS-01® on the microbiome of individuals with occasional digestive issues. Findings showed that DS-01® [significantly enriches / promotes growth of] beneficial bacteria (Bifidobacterium and Lactobacilli)—[increasing beneficial gut microbes by up to 4.6x / supporting over 400% population growth of health-promoting gut microbes] in those with mixed digestive challenges—compared to placebo. Further, DS-01® significantly improved abdominal discomfort and several markers of occasional constipation (BM frequency and stool hardness). Finally, this study showed DS-01® is clinically validated to promote a balanced inflammatory response in individuals with sporadic digestive disturbances.
Notably, administration of DS-01® increased serum (blood) serotonin—a key molecule for digestive motility and sensation—among participants, which suggests a potential mechanism of action for improvement in digestive symptoms.

Version 2 (technical)
We recently completed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial at Harvard Medical School evaluating the impact of DS-01® on the microbiome of individuals with occasional digestive issues. Findings showed that administration of DS-01® resulted in statistically significant increases in beneficial Bifidobacterium (4.6x; p=0.009) and Lactobacilli (4.2x; p=0.003) compared to the placebo group. Additionally, administration of DS-01® led to significant improvements in abdominal discomfort (p=0.036) and measures of occasional constipation—including bowel movement frequency (p=0.038) and stool consistency (p=0.029)—showing 6X more clinical responders (defined as >40% reduction in abdominal discomfort) compared to placebo. Furthermore, this study showed DS-01® is clinically validated to promote a balanced inflammatory response in individuals with sporadic digestive disturbances.
Finally, participants taking DS-01® exhibited increased serum serotonin (p=0.026), indicating a possible mechanism of action to explain the effects observed with their digestive symptoms.

Version 1 (non-technical)
We recently completed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial under Health Canada evaluating the impact of DS-01® on the microbiome of individuals experiencing occasional gut stress. Findings showed that DS-01® [significantly improved gut microbiome composition / beneficially reorganizes/shifts microbiome community structure during temporary GI perturbations] and enriched beneficial bacteria in the gut compared to placebo.
Notably, measures of gut integrity were enhanced via DS-01® supplementation indicating enhanced gut barrier function during times of occasional gut stress. In addition, DS-01® intervention modulates and stabilizes multiple metabolites associated with improved cardiovascular and metabolic function.

Version 2 (technical)
We recently completed a robust 13-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial under Health Canada evaluating the impact of DS-01® on the microbiome of individuals subjected to a 7-day period of gastrointestinal stressors. DS-01® demonstrated significant optimization of gut microbiome composition—specifically, enhancing populations of the beneficial microbes Lactobacillus (up to 90% higher than placebo; p<0.05), and Bifidobacterium (up to 76% higher than placebo; p<0.05), compared to the placebo group, while maintaining baseline microbiome diversity.
Additionally, lactulose challenge tests indicated that DS-01® markedly reinforced gut barrier integrity (mean average 49% less lactulose than placebo; p=0.029) and stabilized a microbial-influenced metabolite pertinent to cardiovascular and metabolic health (p-cresol sulfate, p<0.004).
Finally, DS-01® significantly increases Urolithin A in healthy adults and recovery of Urolithin A in individuals experiencing occasional gut stress.

Research behind PDS
PDS-08® Pediatric Synbiotic is a clinically studied prebiotic and probiotic product formulated with 9 probiotic strains—each with published dose-response data—and mixed-chain prebiotic fibers to preferentially support probiotic activity in the GI tract.
The ingredients in PDS-08® have been clinically studied to support intra- and extra-intestinal benefits including gastrointestinal health, immune function, gut barrier integrity, dermatological health, and respiratory health. You may view the studies associated with each benefit on our reference page here.
Further, PDS-08® is also the first of its kind to be validated in a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial for its effect on regularity and gastrointestinal health. In this study, PDS-08® demonstrated an increased number of weekly bowel movements in children with a previously low frequency of weekly bowel movements (< 5 bowel movements per week), as well as an enrichment of Bifidobacterium in the pediatric gut microbiome. For context, Bifidobacterium are native, commensal bacteria that are linked to the maintenance and improvement of digestive and immune function.
Additionally, when tested in the Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME®)—the premier simulated human intestinal microbial ecosystem assessment tool—PDS-08® led to a significant increase in the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) present in the lower gut compartment. SCFAs play an important role in the maintenance of a healthy gut environment and support other areas of health such as immune and metabolic health.


4. Can I take too many probiotics / how many probiotics per day


Can I take more than 2 capsules per day?
For some context, our recommended daily dose for DS-01® Daily Synbiotic (2 capsules) was derived based on the specific dosages for each strain, at which a benefit was demonstrated in the respective clinical trials and scientific studies.
And while you may certainly choose to experiment with a higher dose, it’s important to note that there is not necessarily any added benefit to doing so. Here, ‘more’ isn't always better—instead, the best dose is typically the one which has been studied to confer specific benefits.
[OPTIONAL ADD ON If they ask about safety of taking more: That said, most of the current literature has not indicated major safety concerns with increased doses of probiotics in healthy individuals (see this review, and this WGO guidance) beyond some potential increased discomfort. For context, unlike certain micronutrients which have recommended upper limits, probiotic organisms do not typically enter into systemic circulation and have not been known to reach levels of toxicity.
Further, as the research on our product, specifically, is confined to our recommended dose, we cannot comment on any effect at an alternate dose (whether higher or lower).
Most importantly, we’d always recommend an informed discussion with your provider if you’re ever concerned about the safety of a supplement, or to ensure any changes to your supplement routine (including a change of dosage) are appropriate for your particular ecosystem. 


Are more probiotics better?
Version 1 (summary / most simple)
For context, benefits for probiotics are assessed at both a strain and dosage level. Our recommended dose of 2 capsules/day with a total of 53.6 billion AFU is based on the dosages used for each strain in their respective clinical trials and scientific studies which demonstrated the conferred benefits.
There are many variables to consider for probiotics: number of strains, number of cells, method of delivery, etc. Each of these factors impacts the specific benefits of the completed product.
This all in mind, and as individual needs are highly variable, it is difficult to state if "more is better" in all circumstances. Higher CFU counts do not necessarily increase benefits and the best dose is the dose that was most efficacious in clinical human studies.
Version 2 (deeper explanation)
Benefits for probiotics are assessed at both a strain and dosage level. For example, our recommended dose of 2 capsules/day—a total of 53.6 billion AFU—is based on the dosages used for each strain in their respective clinical trials and scientific studies which demonstrated the conferred benefits.
There are many variables to consider for probiotics: number of strains, number of cells, method of delivery, etc. Each of these factors impacts the specific benefits of the completed product.
According to one review​, it is generally accepted that probiotic products should have a minimum of 10^6 CFU/mL (or gram) and that a total of 10^8 to 10^9 microorganisms should be consumed daily for the probiotic effect to be transferred to the consumer. The NIH Office of Dietary Supplements​ states "many probiotic supplements contain 1 to 10 billion CFU per dose, but some products contain up to 50 billion CFU or more".
As mentioned above, the dose is highly context-dependent. Another review​ examined the dose-responses of probiotics in various conditions, noting that there is no dose-response relation in some conditions (such as atopic dermatitis) but there is a dose-response effect in others (such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea). You can see the wide range of CFUs used in different clinical trials in this systematic review​ of probiotics, which included looking at micronutrient studies in healthy subjects.
This all in mind, and as individual needs are highly variable, it is difficult to state if "more is better". The most optimal dose is highly dependent on the strains, the potential effects, and the targeted health conditions. Higher CFU counts do not necessarily increase benefits in every scenario, and the best dose is the dose that was most efficacious in clinical human studies.
[OPTIONAL—if asking about AFU/CFU: see What is the difference between CFU and AFU? for more details
We use AFUs rather than CFUs for a more precise measurement of viable cells with flow cytometry. For some background, probiotics​ are defined as "live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host". The key point here is live. The viability of probiotic strains is just as important (if not more) than amount of cells in the product as the bacteria need to be viable to confer health benefits.
You can read more in detail about the differences between AFUs and CFUs in this Cultured article—but in short, CFU by plate counts is one way of detecting live cells but cells can still be viable without the ability to form colonies or replicating. Thus, AFU from flow cytometry is able to better measure the viability of cells as the viability of the strains it utmost important to ensure efficacy. Flow cytometry and plate count enumerations are not the only measurements of viability, but the non-culture based approaches (like flow cytometry) provide a more accurate count. This review stresses the importance of viability and ​​the limitations of CFUs. ]
AFU / CFU difference
Most probiotics use CFU (Colony Forming Units) to show cell count. To determine this number, scientists use a classical plating method used since the 1800s to count the number of cells from a sample that form colonies in a petri dish. Since this method is so manual, this number can vary up to 50% between batches, and it's best for single strains.
In contrast, Seed uses AFU (Active Fluorescent Units) which are measured by flow cytometry—a modern method of counting cells with fluorescent tags, providing a more precise count. Through AFU, we are able to calculate precise measurement of all viable cells, including ones that are efficacious, but not necessarily culturable (and therefore would not be counted in a traditional plated CFU measurement). This is also a more effective way to count each organism in a complex community or multi-species, multi-strain synbiotic formulation.
Since AFU and CFU are two separate measurements, there isn’t a direct way to convert one to the other. A difference in these numbers does not necessarily mean that one product is superior to the other—they're simply different methods of measuring the number of cells which are viable and / or active.
(If you'd like to nerd out a bit more on this topic, I'd highly suggest the following article from our website: CFU vs. AFU: How to Decipher Probiotic Labels​.)

5. What probiotic should I take [including specific scenarios, like in pregnancy] / types of probiotics / how to choose a probiotic / are all probiotics the same


Can you recommend a probiotic?
While we cannot provide direct product recommendations, we are happy to suggest a few pertinent factors to consider when looking for a quality, science-backed probiotic. In addition, you can find a helpful summary of how to choose a probiotic in our Cultured article, Probiotics 101.
1. What evidence-based benefits are you looking for?
Probiotic benefits are assessed at the strain and dosage level, and each unique strain can impart an array of beneficial effects. Since commercial probiotic products can vary widely regarding strains, dosages, and delivery systems, choosing a probiotic that has been demonstrated to confer your desired benefits is essential. First, ask yourself what benefits matter to you, and then ask each company of interest for the evidence and data-generation plans that support their product claims (and ensure there is transparency on the strains included in the product).
2. What quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) measures are important to you?
Quality matters. As a consumer, you should fully understand what is—and isn’t—in a product to feel confident about your consumption. Be sure to ask each company about their pesticide and allergen testing, California's Proposition 65 adherence (concerning identifying potential carcinogens), third-party evaluations, and the governing bodies under which they adhere to specific safety protocols.
3. What data supports probiotic survivability throughout transport, shelf-life, administration [, and digestion, if applicable]?
Beneficial bacteria must be alive at consumption to be considered a probiotic, but the journey from manufacturing through transport and shelf-life can be tumultuous for live microorganisms. Look for products scientifically shown to withstand the shipping, storage, and bodily environments that can impact probiotic viability. Quality probiotic products should deliver live bacteria at or above label claims, specifically to the [target body site/colon] where the microbes perform the bulk of their work.

Difference between DS and [other probiotic]
DS-01® Daily Synbiotic is a 2-in-1 probiotic + prebiotic which combines 24 bacterial strains from the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera, totaling 53.6 Billion AFU (a precise measurement of all viable probiotic cells), as well as a non-fermenting prebiotic concentrated from Indian pomegranate. Further, our registered 2-in-1 nested capsule delivery technology, ViaCap®, is a proprietary capsule-in-capsule system designed to safeguard the viability of the probiotic organisms through digestion, for delivery to the colon (where they work their magic!).
In addition, our product solely includes probiotic strains with extensive safety records, and long-term microbiome stability data in a heterogenous population. We also focused primarily on strains with a robust body of mechanistic and clinical evidence, and which were expected to have benefits for the average healthy adult–these strains have been studied in over 20 preclinical and clinical studies combined to provide benefits for gastrointestinal function, gut barrier integrity, cardiovascular health, gut immune function, micronutrient synthesis, gut metabolite and microbial balance, and dermatological health. If interested, you may view our entire strain list here.
All said, supplements on the market containing probiotics vary widely in regards to probiotic strains, dosages and delivery systems—all of which impact the amount of live bacteria delivered to the colon, and, subsequently, any potential benefits. As benefits for probiotics are assessed at a strain and dosage level, one product cannot simply replace another. If you have any questions about what supplement is right for you, it's best to work with a health care provider who can advise on the appropriate product for your ecosystem and the benefits you desire.
[ Consider inclusion of Cultured articles: How Seed is Setting a New Standard for Probiotics Research, Probiotics 101 ]
Can I take DS with another probiotic
To start, it would be generally safe to take DS-01® Daily Synbiotic alongside another probiotic supplement, as there are no known contraindications to doing so.
For context, benefits for probiotic organisms are assessed at strain and dosage level so depending on the strain and dosage included in each product, benefits for commercial probiotics vary—therefore, one product may not simply replace another.
Further, as most of the current literature has not indicated major safety concerns with increased doses of probiotics in healthy individuals (see this review, and this WGO guidance) beyond some potential increased discomfort, you may choose to do so at your discretion. For context, unlike certain vitamin and mineral micronutrients which have recommended upper limits, probiotic organisms do not typically enter into systemic circulation and have not been known to reach levels of toxicity.
If you have any questions about what supplement is right for you, it's best to work with a healthcare provider who can advise on the appropriate product for your ecosystem based on the unique benefits you desire.
﻿[OPTIONAL ADD-ON]: There may be some functional redundancy if combining our probiotic with other microbial strains in the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera, though many commercial supplements which contain probiotics as additives often omit the strain used so we are unable to say for certain.
What is the difference between DS and multivitamin/probiotic combination product?
For context, probiotics are live microorganisms that provide strain-specific benefits to the host, and prebiotics are utilized by gut microbes to produce certain helpful metabolites. To contrast, multivitamin supplements, such as [competitor multivitamin + probiotic combo product of interest], contain a combination of vitamins + minerals typically with the ultimate goal being to provide the body with essential nutrients it needs to function properly. As such, our DS-01® Daily Synbiotic is not intended to replace any multivitamins or other vitamin-containing greens supplements.
Further, as the benefits of probiotics are assessed at the strain level, it’s important to keep in mind that effects of each probiotic can therefore vary based on the strains contained within, as well as the quality of the product. Thus, all probiotics are not created equal.
In regards to the specific products at hand, DS-01® is a 2-in-1 probiotic + prebiotic which combines 24 bacterial strains from the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera, totaling 53.6 Billion AFU (a precise measurement of all viable probiotic cells), as well as a non-fermenting prebiotic concentrated from Indian pomegranate.
Our probiotic strains come with a long history of mechanistic and clinical research, extensive safety records, and long-term microbiome stability data in a heterogenous population. These strains have been studied in over 20 preclinical and clinical studies combined to provide benefits for gastrointestinal function, gut barrier integrity, cardiovascular health, gut immune function, micronutrient synthesis, gut metabolite and microbial balance, and dermatological health. If interested, you can view our entire strain list here.
In addition, our patented, plant-based, non-fermenting prebiotic compound (punicalagin) is concentrated from Indian pomegranate, which can be metabolized into powerful antioxidant molecules to support a balanced and healthy skin microbiome through the gut-skin axis.
Biogaia
...On the other hand, the BioGaia Immune Active KIDS supplement appears to be a chewable tablet probiotic with a patented strain of probiotic bacteria known as Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938, and benefit claims surrounding the digestive and immune systems. Notably, this specific strain is not contained in PDS-08® for reference.
In sum, the major differences between PDS-08® and BioGaia Immune Active KIDS appear to lie in their compositions (included strains, presence / absence of prebiotics), delivery formats, and targeted benefits. PDS-08® is a clinically studied supplement which offers a unique, powdered blend of nine probiotic strains along with a meaningful dose of prebiotic fiber, with specific benefits in and beyond gut health, whileBioGaia Immune Active KIDS includes a single patented strain, benefit claims for digestive and immune health, and is designed in a chewable tablet format.
Nue
On the other hand, The Nue Co. Pre + Probiotic​ appears to be a soil-based (spore-forming) probiotic supplement that contains a spore-forming organism from the Bacillus genera, for a total of 15 billion spores per dose, according to their website. Do note, however, the label does not specify the probiotic strains, so I am unable to comment on this. In addition, this product contains organic inulin sourced from Jerusalem artichoke root as their prebiotic component.
In sum, the major differences between DS-01® and The Nue Co. Pre + Probiotic appear to lie in their compositions (included strains + prebiotics). So, while DS-01® is a clinically studied synbiotic which offers a unique encapsulated blend of 24 clinically and scientifically studied probiotic strains and a polyphenol-based prebiotic, for benefits in and beyond the gut—The Nue Co.'s Pre + Probiotic formulation is primarily composed of a single spore-forming Bacillus coagulans strain and inulin with benefit claims to support skin, digestion, immunity, mood and sleep.
All said, supplements on the market containing probiotics vary widely in regards to probiotic strains, dosages and delivery systems—all of which impact the amount of live bacteria delivered to the colon, and, subsequently, any potential benefits. As benefits for probiotics are assessed at a strain and dosage level, one product cannot simply replace another. If you have any questions about what supplement is right for you, it's best to work with a health care provider who can advise on the appropriate product for your ecosystem and the benefits you desire.
Bened Life
The major differences between Seed’s DS-01® Daily Synbiotic and Bened Life’s Neuralli MP appear to lie in their compositions (included strains, presence / absence of prebiotics) and their varying benefits claims.
DS-01® Daily Synbiotic is a clinically studied 2-in-1 probiotic + prebiotic which combines 24 studied bacterial strains from the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera, totaling 53.6 Billion AFU (a precise measurement of all viable probiotic cells), as well as a non-fermenting polyphenol-based prebiotic concentrated from Indian pomegranate, for benefits in and beyond the gut.
DS-01® is formulated with probiotic strains that have been studied in over 20 preclinical (in vitro / mechanistic) and clinical (human) studies combined, to support digestive health and beyond–including gut barrier integrity, cardiovascular health, gut immune function, micronutrient synthesis, gut microbial and metabolite balance, and dermatological health.
Our registered 2-in-1 nested capsule delivery technology, ViaCap®, is a proprietary capsule-in-capsule system designed to safeguard the viability of the probiotic organisms through digestion, for delivery to the colon (where they work their magic!).
Bened Life's Neuralli MP appears to contain L. plantarum PS128, and claims to have a total of at least 60 billion CFUs. As for their capsule delivery system, this product incorporates their bacterial strain in a standard single capsule format. According to the product website, Neuralli MP's formulation is primarily composed of one strain with benefit claims to support 'unique dietary needs of people with neurological conditions such as autism & Parkinson’s Disease​.'
DS-01® has not been studied for treating mental health disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, anxiety, ADHD, and eating disorders specifically; therefore, we are unable to comment on any difference in effect or utility within this population.

All said, supplements on the market containing probiotics vary widely in regards to probiotic strains, dosages and delivery systems—all of which impact the amount of live bacteria delivered to the colon, and, subsequently, any potential benefits. As benefits for probiotics are assessed at a strain and dosage level, one product cannot simply replace another. If you have any questions about what supplement is right for you, it's best to work with a health care provider who can advise on the appropriate product for your ecosystem and the benefits you desire.
﻿Bioma
In contrast, Bioma Health​ is a probiotic supplement that contains 3 species of bacteria from the Bifidobacterium genus (no mentions of strain) totaling 9 billion CFU. Bioma Health also contains xylooligosaccharides and tributyrin. Xylooligosaccharides are like other non-digestible carbohydrates (e.g. inulin) used as prebiotics. Tributyrin is a triglyceride (fat) that is a precursor to butyrate—a beneficial metabolite for intestinal health. While promising, a majority of the studies using tributyrin are in ﻿cancer cells​, animal models​, or involved with livestock​, rather than in human populations.

﻿Garden of Life
On the other hand, Once Daily Women's contains 16 probiotic strains from the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera, totaling 50 Billion CFU, as well as an organic prebiotic fiber blend of potato starch and acacia fiber. Do note, however, the label does not specify the probiotic strains, so I am unable to comment on this, or if there is overlap between this product and DS-01®.
So, in sum, while both DS-01® and Once Daily Women's are both classified as synbiotic products, the differences lie in the variety and the dosages of the probiotic strains and the prebiotics used.

Pendulum
...On the other hand, Pendulum Therapeutics offers several probiotic formulations, most of which including strains from the Akkermansia genus, as well as a handful of other unique organisms from the Clostridium, Anaerobutyricum, and Bifidobacterium genera.
[ For example, their Akkermansia supplement contains 100 million AFU of the Akkermansia muciniphila WB-STR-0001 strain and the prebiotic, chicory inulin—suggested to support gut health, gut lining, and GLP-1 production.
Additionally, the Pendulum's GLP-1 Probiotic is a multi-strain synbiotic formulated with Akkermansia muciniphila, Clostridium butyricum, and Bifidobacterium infantis, is advertised to "naturally curb cravings" and to "help individuals produce more GLP-1 naturally through the inclusion of [said strains]." 
[Optional if asking about the background on Akkermansia: For some background on Akkermansia, [insert up to date research]﻿
In sum, the major differences between DS-01® and Pendulum Therapeutics appear to lie in their compositions (included strains, presence / absence of specific prebiotics), delivery formats, and targeted benefits. DS-01® formula contains 24 clinically and scientifically studied probiotic strains and a polyphenol-based prebiotic, for benefits in and beyond the gut, while Pendulum Therapeutics' offers several probiotic formulations—with varying benefit categories, including support of gastrointestinal health, GLP-1 production, and more.

If you have any questions about what supplement is right for you, it's best to work with a health care provider who can advise on the appropriate product for your ecosystem and the benefits you desire.
Emma Daily
...In contrast, Emma Daily Digestive Supplement is a dietary supplement that contains ingredients​ associated with digestive health, such as star anise or berberine. This supplement does not contain probiotics.
All said, probiotics and supplements vary widely in regards to ingredients, dosages (which impacts any potential benefits), and the clinically-studied benefits. We encourage you to take a look at the product specification and approach for any product you are considering to make the best choice based on your specific health needs and goals.
Primal Defense
...On the other hand, Primal Defense appears to be a soil-based (spore-forming) probiotic supplement that contains a number of strains from the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera, as well as spore-forming organisms from the Bacillus and Saccharomyces genera, for a total of 5 billion CFU.
In sum, the major differences between DS-01® and Primal Defense appear to lie in their compositions (including strains used and the presence / absence of prebiotics) and delivery technology. So, while DS-01® is a clinically studied synbiotic which offers a unique encapsulated blend of 24 clinically and scientifically studied probiotic strains and a polyphenol-based prebiotic for benefits in and beyond the gut, Primal Defense's formulation is primarily composed of spore-forming strains from the Bacillus and Saccharomyces genera (as well as a few from Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium) with benefit claims to support normal bowel function and maintenance of a healthy immune system.

Ritual
...In contrast, Ritual’s Gut Health Synbiotic+ is marketed as a 3-in-1 supplement that includes prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics. It includes two bacterial strains from the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera, claiming to contain a total of 11 billion CFU, along with four bacteriophage strains incorporated as a potential prebiotic blend. Additionally, it contains Tributyrin, which is a synthetically derived ingredient with claims of functioning as a postbiotic.
That said, if you're interested in learning more about the differences between various '-biotics'—you can check out our Cultured article, ‘Your Definitive Guide to All the '-Biotics'.’﻿
In sum, the major differences between Seed’s DS-01® Daily Synbiotic and Ritual’s Gut Health Synbiotic+ appear to lie in their compositions (included strains and prebiotics, and the inclusion/exclusion of a postbiotic component). So, while DS-01® is a clinically studied, broad spectrum synbiotic offering a unique encapsulated blend of 24 clinically and scientifically studied probiotic strains from the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera and a polyphenol-based prebiotic, for benefits in and beyond the gut—Ritual’s Gut Health Synbiotic+ formulation is primarily composed of two probiotics strains from the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera in addition to other ingredients with benefit claims to support a balanced gut microbiome.

If you have any questions about what supplement is right for you, it's best to work with a health care provider who can advise on the appropriate product for your ecosystem and the benefits you desire.
﻿AG1
...On the other hand, Athletic Greens (AG1®) is a dietary supplement that contains a number of ingredients, including vitamins + minerals, a phytonutrient blend, and two probiotic strains from the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera which totals 7.2 billion CFU.
Further, while AG1® comes in a powdered format, DS-01® strains are safely housed in our registered 2-in-1 nested capsule delivery technology, ViaCap®, which is a proprietary capsule-in-capsule system designed to safeguard the viability of the probiotic organisms through digestion for delivery to the colon.
In sum, DS-01® and AG1® are two fundamentally different supplement categories—with AG1® being a predominantly a whole-foods based greens powder with added vitamins and minerals, phytonutrients, and two probiotic strains, whereas DS-01® is a clinically studied synbiotic product offering a unique, encapsulated blend of 24 clinically and scientifically studied probiotic strains and a polyphenol-based prebiotic, to provide benefits in and beyond the gut.
All said, supplements on the market containing probiotics vary widely in regards to probiotic strains, dosages and delivery systems—all of which impact the amount of live bacteria delivered to the colon, and, subsequently, any potential benefits.

[OPTIONAL ADD-ON: To note, there may be some functional redundancy as Athletic Greens also contains probiotics within the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera; however, unlike with some vitamins and minerals, probiotics have not been shown to reach levels of toxicity as they do not enter systemic circulation. That said, it's important that any company is transparent about the scientific studies and benefits associated with the strains in their product and that that product has undergone rigorous testing for potency and purity, and also survives in GI transit. ]
Spore-based probiotics
Version 1 (summary / most simple)
Spore-based or spore-forming probiotics are soil-based microorganisms which are formed from spores found in dirt and vegetation. While most traditional probiotic strains—such as those included in DS-01® from the Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria genera—are similar to those naturally found in the human gastrointestinal tract, spore-based probiotics are derived from other species and are delivered as dormant/inactive spores.
Interestingly, some preliminary scientific research supports the potential benefits of certain soil-based or spore-forming bacteria in human probiotic products. The most commonly studied strains are soil-based microbes from the Bacillus genus, including strains from the species Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus clausii.
While there is promising research surrounding spore-forming probiotics, further clinical studies should be performed to examine specific bacterial strains and blends in relation to widespread benefits within a heterogeneous population.
Additionally, data surrounding potential safety concerns—such as bacteremia in immune-compromised patients, as raised in this 2017 review—should be further investigated on a strain-by-strain basis.
Version 2 (deeper explanation)
[SciCare note: The introduction of this paper has a nice overview of the benefits of spore-based probiotics for a deeper dive]
There is preliminary but growing scientific and clinical research to support the benefit of certain soil-based or spore-forming bacteria for implementation in human probiotic products. The most commonly studied strains are soil-based microbes from the Bacillus genus, including strains from the species Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus clausii.
Spore-forming species and strains have been studied in several specific populations. For example, a pilot study on Bacillus coagulans MTCC 5856 has shown promise for prevention of depression in patients with IBS. In addition, results of a 2014 study indicated that supplementation of Bacillus coagulans improved abdominal pain and diarrhea in IBS patients, although the specific strain of Bacillus coagulans was not specified.
Further, an in vitro analysis of the strain Bacillus subtilis DE111® explored its ability to survive harsh gastric transit, in addition to its metabolic activities, which have the potential to confer health benefits to the host. Importantly, however, this study was not performed on humans, meaning the results are not necessarily transferable.]Spore-based probiotics contain soil-based/spore-forming microorganisms that are found naturally in soil and vegetation. [Potential add: If the supplement contains strains of the Bacillus genus, it’s usually a spore-based probiotic!]
While there is promising research surrounding spore-forming probiotics, further clinical studies should be performed to examine specific bacterial strains and blends in relation to widespread benefits within a heterogeneous population.
Additionally, data surrounding potential safety concerns—such as bacteremia in immune-compromised patients, as raised in this 2017 review—should be further investigated on a strain-by-strain basis.
Topical probiotics + skin - dermatitis
Fungal and bacterial​​ species in the skin microbiome​ play a role in seborrheic dermatitis (SD) and dandruff. Currently, more research needs to be done to understand the relationship between probiotics and SD or dandruff.
One clinical trial​ found a strain, Lactobacillus paracasei NCC 2461 ST11, was able to reduce symptoms and severity of dandruff, albeit in healthy (non-SD) volunteers. Another trial​ using L. crispatus P17631 and L. paracasei I1688 found decreases in Malassezia (main fungal species involved in SD) and reductions in SD severity index scoring.
However, it is important to note that majority of such studies use topical​ probiotics (suspensions/creams) for SD or dandruff treatment to potentially directly modulate and affect the skin microbiome.
This all in mind, further studies and clinical trials are needed to better assess the strains and dosages needed, the route of administration, and the composition of the probiotic (i.e. cream vs oil) on efficacy of treating SD patients.
Topical probiotics + hair loss
To date, there has been quite a bit of clinical research on probiotics and skin. However, while there is preliminary data (in animals) studying the role of the microbiome during hair loss, a conclusive understanding is yet to be determined. For context, human skin and hair are host to a vast diversity of microorganisms, and the establishment of an equilibrium is crucial for a healthy skin barrier. The skin microbiome has been extensively studied, while less work has covered those in the dermis and hair follicle.
It's important to note, since all systems are interconnected, it is possible that probiotics could support the hair follicle, although there is extremely limited scientific or clinical data in humans to suggest this.
Interestingly, one recent clinical trial​ found that participants with androgenetic alopecia (the most common cause of hair loss) who consumed an oral probiotic experienced less progression of hair loss—and in some cases, thicker and longer hair—as compared to participants who took a placebo. However, many of these effects varied by age, and more human clinical trials are needed to confirm these benefits and determine which strains, dosages, and application systems (oral vs. topical) would best support the prevention or remediation of hair loss.
Lastly, therapies for dermatological and hair regeneration is certainly not a 'one size fits all' solution. We would recommend consulting with a health care provider as well, as they will be able to advise within the context of your personal medical history.
Oral probiotics
The oral microbiome harbors its own unique ecosystem of around 700 different microbial species. (Interestingly, research shows that there is also a connection between the gut microbiome and oral microbiome, although a clear understanding of how, and in what ways, is still actively being researched.)
The oral microbiome has been implicated in its connection to illness and disease, playing a direct role in the development of dental caries (cavities) and periodontal disease. Recent findings suggest that probiotics may have the potential to help.
For context, one way periodontal conditions occur begins with the congregation of plaque bacteria in the mouth. Probiotics can help in a few ways: lowering oral pH (and therefore, preventing conditions which plaque bacteria thrive), producing antioxidants (which neutralize elements needed for plaque/mineral formation), and breaking down toxic gases into elements necessary for metabolism—thereby also working against malodor.
Notably, while further study is still needed in this field, species and strains from the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium genera have been researched most thoroughly on the topic to date.
Oral/Dental + Gut / 'bad breath' option
Halitosis
It is known the oral microbiome can affect the gut microbiota—the oral to gut transmission​ is better studied than the reverse. One possible gut to oral transmission is rather more focused on fecal-oral​ transmission. However, there are some studies that suggest gut dysbiosis​ may have an impact on the oral microbiota; albeit, these studies were conducted under the context of diabetes.
While probiotics supplementation is actively researched for halitosis treatment, these generally involved a slow-release oral tablet​ (not ingested), chewable tablet​, gum​, or an oral rinse​. Effects of orally-ingested probiotics have been less investigated for halitosis.
In sum, the oral-gut axis is better studied in one direction than the other (gut to oral) and the use of probiotics for halitosis requires further studies and trials. 
Ophthalmic probiotics
There is emerging research on the 'gut-eye axis', regarding the connection between the gut microbiome and that of the eye, and whether dysbiosis of the gut microbiome may influence ocular diseases. In this article​ from the American Academy of Ophthalmology, researchers explore more about any potential relationship and studies surrounding this relationship.
Further, this ﻿review​​ suggests the importance of the gut microbiota in ocular inflammatory diseases such as uveitis, keratitis, and age-related macular degeneration. Moreover, studies are examining the gut microbiota's influence on complications of non-ocular eye concerns, such as diabetic retinopathy​​ and Graves' orbitopathy​.
Regarding such conditions potentially involving the gut-eye axis, the idea of probiotic use to support ophthalmic health has been considered.
One such study​ found probiotics may help with dry eye—as this condition is associated with inflammation, the gut microbiota modulation of inflammation may be one potential method to manage dry eyes. That said, another study​ found oral probiotics were not effective for dry eye patients, while an eye drop containing a post-biotic (dead bacterial components) was effective in improving symptoms.
That said, a majority of these studies are done in vitro or in mice and require further studies with human subjects to better understand the ocular microbiome and ophthalmic diseases. Therefore, as this field is relatively new and continuously evolving, more studies + rigorous trials are needed to understand the role of probiotics and/or the gut microbiota in ophthalmic health and disease.
﻿
Version 2 (deeper explanation)
Interestingly, while it has been debated whether microorganisms are able to colonize the ocular surface due to the lacrimal gland producing lysozymes that can kill bacteria, studies have shown the existence of an 'ocular microbiome'​.
Similar to the gut microbiome, studies suggest that alterations to the ocular microbiome may be related to several ophthalmic diseases such as blepharitis​, conjuctivitis​, keratitis​, and dry eye syndrome​. 
For example, Chlamydia trachomatis—the causative agent of trachoma, the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide—was shown to be associated with reduced bacterial diversity​ and an increase in certain types of bacteria seen in patients with conjunctival scarring. Interestingly, preliminary research indicates that contact lens usage ​alters the microbial structure of the ocular microbiome—one suggesting this shift may be closer to the skin microbiome​.
However, it is important to note that while theses studies are promising, more research needs to be conducted before any firm conclusions can be drawn. Understanding of the commensal bacteria and their functions, causative agents of alterations to the microbiome structure, and the effects of addition or removal of certain bacteria are all important knowledge needed before moving towards therapeutics regarding the ocular microbiome. 
Akkermansia
﻿Research has demonstrated that richness of A. muciniphila is generally associated with a healthy gut. This bacterium appears to be more abundant in the gut of healthy subjects than in that of diabetic and obese patients, as well as those with bowel diseases. Interventional studies have found that A. muciniphila abundance is inversely correlated with body weight, inflammation, metabolic syndrome, and both type 1 and 2 diabetes.
One of A. muciniphila’s specific niches is to degrade and thrive off of mucins, a type of protein found in epithelial tissues. With the ability to participate in mucin processing, it is thought to have a positive impact on gut barrier integrity, contribute to the production of healthful short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and may provide defense from pathogens.
In one study featuring human subjects deemed clinically overweight/obese and with insulin resistance, A. muciniphila was able to markedly and significantly improve several parameters related to glucose metabolism and cardiometabolic risk—namely, improved insulin sensitivity indices, decreased insulin resistance (HOMA-IR method), and decreased WBC (white blood cell) counts (another marker associated with obesity, and increased risk for T2D).
In a rodent study, direct supplementation with A. muciniphila led to upregulated host colonic mucus production, though was not reported to significantly reshape gut microbiota composition.
From what we know about probiotics—with science supporting the transient nature of probiotic organisms—A. muciniphila supplementation may be providing benefits not through changing the gut’s overall bacterial composition, but instead altering gene expression patterns relevant to metabolism in the host’s resident gut microbes.
To note, A. muciniphila is a resident microbe of the human gut, naturally, whose abundance can be improved (and sustained) by many alternate means aside from an A. muciniphila oral probiotic. Supplementation of certain prebiotics, dietary interventions (diets high in plant polyphenols, fibers, and antioxidants), and certain medications (metformin, as well as select antibiotics such as vancomycin) have been reported in literature to modulate levels of A. muciniphila.
Typical probiotics on the market today rarely contain this species despite its natural abundance, due to several logistical challenges in culturing it—namely, being a strict anaerobe (this species requires a 100% oxygen-free environment to culture), and in the words of one research review, “inconspicuous cell morphology, small size and specific carbon source requirements”.
You may find interesting that despite the promise of its application in regards to metabolic health, controversies currently exist regarding the effect of A. muciniphila on other diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colitis. For example, this study observed the specific strain, A. muciniphila ATCC BAA-835, to alleviate acute colitis in mice, but the same strain was demonstrated to aggravate gut inflammation in mice infected with Salmonella Typhimurium.
In sum, it's true that strains of A. muciniphila have been shown to have clinical benefits—most notably surrounding weight regulation and metabolic disorders, and they are included in some probiotic products. With this said, further studies are needed to reproduce benefits related to metabolic health more widespread utility across a broad range of health concerns.
Does DS-01® support the production of Akkermansia?
We haven't conducted research on whether or not DS-01® supports or detracts from the growth of Akkermansia muciniphila in the gut, but we're happy to share some relevant research on your topic of concern.
As you may already know, Akkermansia muciniphila is a resident microbe of the human gut, naturally, whose abundance can be improved (and sustained) by many alternate means aside from an A. muciniphila-specific oral probiotic. Supplementation of certain prebiotics, dietary interventions (diets high in plant polyphenols, fibers, and antioxidants), and certain medications (metformin, as well as select antibiotics such as vancomycin) have been reported in literature to modulate levels of A. muciniphila.
It's important to preface with the fact that one of A. muciniphila’s specific niches is to degrade and thrive off of mucins, a type of protein found in epithelial tissues. With the ability to participate in mucin processing, it is thought to have a positive impact on gut barrier integrity, contribute to the production of healthful short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and provide defense from pathogens.
As far as the literature on consuming probiotics from the Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium genera to increase Akkermansia abundance is concerned, the currently held idea that some research supports is that traditional probiotics increase SCFA production, which in turn promotes mucin growth, helping foster the growth of A. muciniphila (recall that this microbial species is a mucin-"eater"!).
There have been some preliminary animal model studies demonstrating that traditional Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium based probiotics may increase A. muciniphila abundance in fecal content. Despite this research, it still remains to be elucidated whether or not this applies to human subjects. Therefore, we wouldn't advise using our product, or other Lactobacillus- and/or Bifidobacterium- based probiotics as a reliable way to increase natural abundance levels of this microbe.
All of this being said, if you feel that additional value may be provided by an additional A. muciniphila supplement, there should be no contraindication to combining them.
Histamine
For context, there are some strains of Lactobacillus probiotics that can suppress intestinal inflammation by producing metabolites that promote the conversion of dietary histidine into histamine. This bacteria-based metabolic activity is an essential aspect of a healthy immune system and certain strains within the species Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus bulgaricus promote this metabolic conversion. That said, while DS-01® does contain other strains within these species, our formulation does not contain any strains which have been shown to raise histamine levels (as every strain within a species is entirely different).
effects of histamine-producing strains [PROS + CONS]
It is important to note, however, that the science is complicated. While histamine may pose a problem for certain individuals, the production of histamine can be helpful in other individuals and has been implicated as the key mechanism by which some probiotic strains are protective. For example, there has been research investigating certain strains of Lactobacillus probiotics—for example, several strains of L. reuteri—that can release immunomodulatory factors to suppress intestinal inflammation by promoting the conversion of dietary histidine into histamine—which, in this case, will actually have an anti-inflammatory impact by triggering the inhibition of downstream inflammatory signaling. These strains have shown promising insight into microbes as therapeutic agents for acute colitis and inflammation-associated colon cancer.
It is proposed that this unique ability of histamine to exert both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects depending on the circumstance may be a result of differences in structural modification of histamine based on its origin of production: when specifically produced by a L. reuteri, its structural features actually show variance that may contribute to L. reuteri's anti-inflammatory effects.
Therefore, histamine generated by intestinal microbes may even offer new possibilities and understanding into the role of microbes in mediating inflammation within the gastrointestinal tract. ]
DAO Enzyme activity
Histamine produced in the digestive tract is naturally degraded by an enzyme called diamine oxidase (DAO). Some people with MCAS/histamine intolerance do not have enough DAO, and therefore have trouble properly breaking down histamine in their bodies—leading to an accumulation of the amine that can lead to a variety of symptoms.
Knowing this, individuals with an intolerance to histamine can have varying reactions to probiotics such as DS-01®. Therefore, to be prudent, we would encourage consulting your personal physician to assess your degree of histamine intolerance and to advise on the need for avoiding certain strains of probiotics.]
Histamine + DS
We've conducted in vitro testing on our product, which demonstrated that DS-01® Daily Synbiotic strains do not raise levels of histamine under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. With this known, in most instances, DS-01® would be generally safe for individuals with histamine intolerance to take.
A caveat with in vitro testing, however, is that, despite the ability to produce efficient preliminary results, these studies often fail to replicate the conditions of a human body. And as a company rooted in science, we often inform our members of the potential inability of in vitro results to replicate in real world conditions.
Knowing this, individuals with an intolerance to histamine can have varying reactions to probiotics such as DS-01®. Therefore, to be prudent, we would encourage you to consult with your personal physician to assess your degree of histamine intolerance and to advise on the need for avoiding certain strains of probiotics.
Can I take DS while pregnant/breastfeeding?
Probiotics and prebiotics are generally considered safe for use during pregnancy [and while breastfeeding], and do not pose any serious health concerns to the mother or infant. A recent umbrella review of meta-analyses and systematic reviews on the topic supports the finding that no serious adverse effects for mother or infant are associated with intake of probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics during pregnancy.
However, as with any dietary supplement or new health protocol contemplated during pregnancy or lactation, we recommend speaking with your physician or obstetrician before adding DS-01® to your routine.

Interestingly, the strains Lactobacillus plantarum SD-LP1-IT and Bifidobacterium breve SD-BR3-IT were examined in a 300-person study for their support of several gastrointestinal functions, including bowel movement regularity, stool consistency, ease of expulsion, bowel movement comfort, and occasional bloating.
Another one of our strains, Bifidobacterium longum SD-BB536-JP, was studied for its potential ability to promote improvement in intestinal environment, defecation frequency, and fecal characteristics.
Constipation
DS-01® is formulated to ease intermittent constipation and support healthy regularity. Interestingly, the strains Lactobacillus plantarum SD-LP1-IT and Bifidobacterium breve SD-BR3-IT were examined in a 300-person study for their support of several gastrointestinal functions, including bowel movement regularity, stool consistency, ease of expulsion, bowel movement comfort, and occasional bloating. If interested, you may view our clinical and scientific studies here.﻿
[related: Hemorrhoids
While the development of hemorrhoids, or piles, is often attributed to strain that is placed on the veins in the anus or rectum, it can also be attributable to different gastrointestinal disorders (such as Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis). Additionally, the microbiome has been implicated as one possible way to mediate hemorrhoids, by way of facilitating intestinal motility and assisting with constipation.
﻿Scientific literature indicates promising results for the use of probiotics in patients with gastrointestinal diseases, such as decreased pain, diarrhea, bloating, gas, and mucus production. The general mechanisms include improved gut barrier integrity, balanced immune responses, and favorable changes in the levels of a number of metabolites that are associated with lowered levels of mucosal inflammation. ]
﻿diarrhea
DS-01® was formulated with a wide variety of strains selected to support overall digestive health. Several of the strains in DS-01® have been shown to significantly improve multiple markers of gastrointestinal function, including improved stool consistency and quality. If interested, you may view our clinical and scientific studies here.
﻿Is DS safe to take with X medication?
There are no known contraindications between probiotics and medications; therefore, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic would be generally safe to take alongside any prescription or over-the-counter medication(s).
[Insert additional rx information here, specific to the medication asked about]
Ultimately, we always recommend consulting with a prescribing physician regarding the combined utility of DS-01® and any medications in your routine, so they may advise with the complete knowledge of your health history and the specific medication.
Can I take DS if I have undergone X procedure?


DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied specifically in individuals who have undergone [XXX procedure], so we cannot comment directly on the safety or suitability of taking DS-01® in this circumstance. We would ultimately defer to the advice of your physician on the timing and use of DS-01® (and any additional dietary supplements) while undergoing any medical procedures or tests. You may be interested to note… [Insert procedure-specific information].
Colonoscopy:
The general guidelines for a colonoscopy procedure state individuals are to adhere to a clear liquid diet and to consume a laxative formulation the day before and/or day of your procedure as to clear your colon in preparation. With this in mind, it may be prudent to discuss your DS-01® intake with your physician during this time.﻿
Gastric bypass
It is possible that the capsule could be ejected too quickly from the upper gut and appear in the stool partially intact. With this in mind, it may be prudent to start by taking one capsule daily for the first week and checking your stool for any remnants of the capsules before increasing to the full recommended dosage of 2 capsules/day.
[insert doctor's rec and/or additional info Bariatric-Surgery-Gastrectomy]
Gastric Sleeve
That said, as DS-01® has been studied for its precision release in the intestines, it is possible that the capsule could be ejected too quickly from the upper gut and appear in the stool partially intact.
This in mind, should you decide to try incorporating DS-01® into your routine, it may be prudent to start by taking one capsule daily for the first week and checking your stool for any remnants of the capsules before increasing to the full recommended dosage of 2 capsules/day.
[insert doctor's rec and/or additional info Bariatric-Surgery-Gastrectomy]
Gall Bladder Removal
At this time, there is minimal clinical research on probiotic use after gallbladder removal.
Science is just beginning to reveal that the gallbladder harbors its own microbial ecosystem, which is likely to also contribute to the gastrointestinal environment. Research shows that patients who have had their gallbladder removed have an altered gut microbiome with reduced strain diversity.
While the gallbladder is an important component of overall digestion (specifically the digestion of fats through the secretion of a class of enzymes known as lipases), the gallbladder is not essential in the processing of DS-01®—nor would the removal of the gallbladder generally be contraindicated in those wishing to take our product.
[insert doctor's rec]
Colectomy (Colon resection)
At this time, the scientific literature surrounding the use of probiotics in individuals who have undergone a colectomy specifically is limited.
Of note, DS-01® is specifically designed to deliver the probiotics to the colon (where most of their work happens). The capsules are acid-resistant and delayed-release in order to counter the conditions they will encounter in the GI tract.
This in mind, it is possible that the capsule could be ejected too quickly from the upper gut, and possibly appear in the stool partially or fully intact. Therefore we would suggest taking one capsule for the first week or so, and checking your stool for any remnants of the capsules, before increasing to the full recommended dosage of 2 capsules/day.
[insert doctor's rec]
Feeding Tube
It is important to note, we designed our 2-in-1 capsule system, the ViaCap®, to be consumed orally. Under normal circumstances, the outer cap opens in the stomach, collapsing upon the inner cap and acting as a secondary buffer. The prebiotic is fully released in the small intestines, and the probiotic begins release in the small intestines through transit into the colon.
This in mind, if the outer capsule has been compromised or removed, it is likely that the capsules would break down at different timing within the GI tract, though we would be unable to say for sure as we have not conducted testing.
Furthermore, each of our strains were clinically evaluated for their benefit after oral ingestion, and we have designed DS-01® to deliver the same strains, in the same dosages, and via the same route as their respective clinical trials.
With this in mind [insert doctor's rec]
Gastrectomy
At this time, the scientific literature surrounding the use of probiotics in individuals living with a gastrectomy is very limited, though appears promising for improving gut-immune response status, reducing severity of inflammation, and improving overall quality of life. And, for context, our probiotic is designed and tested specifically for delivery to the colon—where the majority of the gut microbiome resides. Therefore, lacking a stomach should not impact the efficacy of DS-01®; that said, the cadence of capsule deterioration in the GI tract may be impacted.
[OPTIONAL ADD ON if asking about still receiving benefit from ds: To further elaborate, we've specifically tested DS-01® to ensure the bacteria stay alive and viable through the stomach and small intestine, so that it safely makes it to the colon. This in mind, an intact stomach is not needed to receive the benefits.]
This in mind, should you decide to try incorporating DS-01® into your routine, it may be prudent to start by taking one capsule daily for the first week and checking your stool for any remnants of the capsules before increasing to the full recommended dosage of 2 capsules/day.
[insert doctor's rec]
VACCINE
DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied specifically within the context of those being administered [X Vaccine], so we cannot comment directly on the safety or suitability of taking DS-01® in this circumstance. We would ultimately defer to the advice of your physician on the timing and use of DS-01® while undergoing any medical procedures.
That being said, in general, there are no known contraindications between probiotics and vaccines. You may also be interested to know that probiotics have been explored as an adjuvant​ to vaccine therapy, and a systematic review​ of 26 studies exploring 40 probiotic strains suggests that probiotics offer a relatively cheap intervention to improve vaccine efficacy and duration of protection.


6. Should I take probiotics every day ? how long should I take probiotics?


Can I take only one capsule per day?
Main — 'Why 2 capsules?'
Our recommended dosage for DS-01® Daily Synbiotic is 2 capsules per day at 53.6 Billion AFU, which is our research-derived dosage and the dosage at which DS-01® is being evaluated in clinical trials. This is why we encourage taking the full dose of 2 capsules per day, instead of just 1.
'Feel discomfort at 2 capsules'
Ideally, we recommend taking the full daily dose of 2 capsules of DS-01® because this is our research-derived dosage and the dosage at which DS-01® is being evaluated in clinical trials.
However, some individuals may be sensitive to higher potency probiotics and I completely understand trying to find a routine and dosage that works best for your particular ecosystem. Everyone has a unique physiology and it is entirely possible that you will still experience benefits at a lower dosage, so feel free to prescribe what feels best for your body. That said, we haven't conducted studies to obtain clinical data at a lower dose, so this is important to keep in mind as you experiment.
'Do I NEED to take two capsules? / Can I just take 1 per day?'
Benefits for probiotics are assessed at both a strain and dosage level. Our recommended dosage for DS-01® Daily Synbiotic is 2 capsules per day at 53.6 Billion AFU which is our research-derived dosage and the dosage at which DS-01® is being evaluated in clinical trials. [OPTIONAL ADD ON if asking about dose adjustment for body weight/size: Therefore, there is no need to adjust the dose based on body size or weight. ]
As a science-backed company, it is important for us to use evidence to inform our recommendations for use—which is why we cannot say for certain whether an alternate dosage would be beneficial or health promoting. While some of our members might report feeling better on one capsule instead of the full dose, they may be missing out on the full spectrum of clinically and scientifically studied benefits.
However, we also believe anecdotes and personal experience are immensely valuable. Please feel free to utilize a lower daily dose of DS-01® if this feels better for your particular ecosystem.
(Cost concern) 'Can I take just one capsule?'
We totally understand—subscriptions can add up. And when you’re thinking about your budget, something extra for your health might feel extraneous.
For some context, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic includes 24 clinically and scientifically studied strains sourced globally (many of which are exclusive to us), a new class of non-fermenting prebiotic compounds (built around a patented whole fruit extract), and reflects advanced technologies and innovations in biofermentation, stabilization, delivery, stability, and testing.
Our recommended daily dosage for DS-01® is 2 capsules at 53.6 Billion AFU which is our research-derived dosage and the dosage at which DS-01® is being evaluated in clinical trials. We have not conducted studies to obtain clinical data at 1 capsule daily, therefore we can not guarantee benefits or effects at this dose.
As a 2-in-1 (probiotics + prebiotics), we landed on the current cost per daily dose for a product that delivers multiple benefits beyond digestive health—including skin health, heart health, gut immune function, gut barrier integrity, and micronutrient synthesis—but we also recognize that this isn’t feasible for everyone. We continue to strive for price points that are accessible for all—and this includes the products to come in our pipeline.


7. Probiotics for women / sex difference + probiotics; age
Why is there not a probiotic differentiated by sex?
We do not have separate male and female formulations—however, you may be aware that we used to. In Fall of 2019, we unified our adult synbiotic into a single unisex formulation: DS-01® Daily Synbiotic.
For context, contrary to nutritional guidelines for other compounds such as micronutrients (vitamins + minerals) and macronutrients (including things like protein and fiber), probiotic recommendations are not differentiated based on biological sex.
Benefits for probiotic organisms are assessed on both a strain (for example, Lactobacillus plantarum SD-LP1-IT) and dosage (for example, 10 million CFU) level. In addition, apart from a few specified areas (such as reproductive health), research in probiotics is conducted mostly in heterogenous populations (which means both men and women are included).
Furthermore, science has revealed that In 2007, the National Institute of Health spearheaded a $173 million Human Microbiome Project (HMP) with the goal of characterizing the human microbiome and to determine if changes in microbiome composition could be correlated with health and disease. The project encompassed 5 years of research and over 200 scientists—and concluded in 2012 that there is no universally healthy microbiome.
While there are preliminary findings which demonstrate differences in the microbiome(s) of men and women, the HMP revealed that the metabolic function of our microbiome is much more important than which microbial species are present. This means what your bacteria are doing is much more important than who they are.
Of note as well, the magnitude of the contribution of biological sex to the gut microbiota is not so clear when compared with other factors such as diet, lifestyle and medication.
This all in mind, most scientifically-supported probiotics on the market today are unisex and look at specific strains of beneficial bacteria that have been studied in a heterogenous population. You may access our strain-specific clinical trials here.
[Care macro - basic/simple version]: Who is DS for (sex/gender identity)


DS-01® is for all humans ages 18+, regardless of sex or gender identity, and was formulated with research conducted in heterogenous populations (including men and women).


I hear your feedback around our commercials, and understand why this may have been confusing. Our sincerest apologies, and I’ve passed this along to our Creative Team so we can evolve moving forward.




Menstrual Cycle + Gut Microbiome / Oral Probiotics
[optional addition if asking about menstrual cycle changes during acclimation] First, I'd like to provide some information on what to expect as your body acclimates to DS-01® Daily Synbiotic, including steps you can take to explore potential causes for your symptoms. Next, I can also offer some insight on the science behind menstruation and the microbiome that you may find interesting.
[acclimation verbiage as needed I am feeling [UNCOMMON acclimation symptom] is this normal? ]
The gut microbiome is one of the main regulators of estrogen balance, which has led to the identification of the estrogen-gut microbiome axis. Under certain circumstances (such as while taking some medications, or immediately following weight-loss surgery), a disruption of the gut microbiome can lead to decreased circulating estrogens. However, probiotics are not known to upset that system (and in fact, can sometimes be included as a part of recommended health regimens following such disruptions).
So while there are many common causes for menstrual cycle changes, based on the existing body of clinical research, it is unlikely that these occurrences would be related to the use of a probiotic.
Version 2 (deeper explanation)
[optional addition if asking about menstrual cycle changes during acclimation] First, I'd like to provide some information on what to expect as your body acclimates to DS-01® Daily Synbiotic, including steps you can take to explore potential causes for your symptoms. Second, I can also offer some insight on the science behind menstruation and the microbiome that you may find interesting.
[acclimation verbiage as needed I am feeling [UNCOMMON acclimation symptom] is this normal? ]
As you may know, there are two noteworthy hormones involved in the menstrual cycles: estrogen and progesterone​. Understanding how these chemical messengers work can inform the way we look at the interconnection between the microbiome and menstrual cycles.
* As a quick refresher, although every body is different, most menstrual cycles last for about 28 days and are divided into distinct phases: the follicular phase (the first 14 days or so after your period), ovulation, the luteal phase (time between ovulation and your period), and the menstrual phase (aka menses or your period).
* Estrogen levels rise before the midpoint of your cycle (the follicular phase), drop down briefly during ovulation, rise again during the luteal phase, then sink to their lowest levels during the menstrual phase. This hormone helps the muscles of your GI tract move smoothly and can even modulate pain responses.
* Progesterone levels peak during the luteal phase. This hormone can affect how the smooth muscles of the GI tract function, sometimes leading to constipation.​
Interestingly, the gut microbiome is one of the main regulators of estrogen balance, which has led to the identification of the estrogen-gut microbiome axis. Under certain circumstances (such as while taking some medications, or immediately following weight-loss surgery), a disruption of the gut microbiome can lead to decreased circulating estrogens. However, probiotics are not known to upset that system (and in fact, can sometimes be included as a part of recommended health regimens following such disruptions).
[Pull from Menstrual Cycle + Vaginal Microbiome / Vaginal Suppository Probiotics if helpful]
To summarize, there are many common causes for menstrual cycle changes, but based on the existing body of clinical research, it is unlikely that these occurrences would be related to the use of a probiotic.


Does DS support vaginal health
Kindly note, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied or formulated for any effects on vaginal or reproductive health, so we do not make any claims in this regard.
For context, DS-01® is a unisex synbiotic formulated with 24 select strains which have been shown in clinical and scientific studies to support benefits for gastrointestinal function, gut barrier integrity, cardiovascular health, gut immune function, gut microbial balance, gut metabolite balance, micronutrient synthesis and dermatological health.
While the vaginal microbiome is a very important factor in women's health, when it comes to oral probiotics, there simply isn't a direct physiological path for the microbes to travel from the GI tract/colon to the vagina. Therefore, there is much still to be understood with respect to how oral probiotics modify vaginal health outcomes. Interestingly, some researchers​ hypothesize that oral probiotic supplementation can affect vaginal microbial communities by way of the immune system, although, importantly, mechanisms have yet to be elucidated.
Finally, on a relevant and exciting note, we have developed our first product for vaginal health, as the first innovation to emerge from our LUCA Biologics engine. VS-01™ Vaginal Synbiotic is the first vaginal suppository formulated with three proprietary Lactobacillus crispatus strains—the vagina’s super defender bacteria—and it’s clinically validated to restore a healthy vaginal microbiome, sustain regulated vaginal pH, and is safe for long-term use. It’s a new approach to vaginal health for one of the most delicate ecosystems of the human body. For a detailed breakdown of the benefits, formulation and clinical trial data for VS-01™, I’d suggest checking out our product page here. 
Who can take DS (age based)
DS-01® Daily Synbiotic is specifically formulated with adults (18+) in mind, as this is the age group in which our probiotic strains and respective dosages have been studied for both safety and efficacy. However, the probiotic strains are safe and tolerable for children/teens with a steady-state microbiome (3+ years). Therefore, it should generally be fine for your [child/teen/insert specific age if provided] to try DS-01®. For more information on our extensive testing and safety protocols, or to learn more about our clinical trials, feel free to visit our DS-01® product page.
Please note, if you decide to try DS-01® for your [child/teen], we suggest they be able to swallow the capsules whole, as the capsules are specially designed to protect the probiotic organisms through the GI tract and should remain intact in order to do so.
Ultimately, we always encourage consulting your family's pediatrician before starting your [child/teen] on any health regimen, as they may advise with the added knowledge of your [child/teen]'s health history.
[OPTIONAL expansion on safety/testing: Our strains have been evaluated in over 20 pre-clinical (in vitro/mechanistic) and clinical (human) studies combined. In addition, DS-01® was well-tolerated in our double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials, with no Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) reported.
Finally, DS-01® undergoes consistent, extensive third party testing for potency and contamination, and purity is monitored under both US and European protocols (including cGMP + HACCP). This process includes testing for over 500 different pesticides, over 20 allergens (including 14 classes of allergens defined by the European Food and Safety Authority (EFSA)), and over 50 quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) checkpoints. ]
[OPTIONAL ADD ON if asking about dose adjustment for body weight/size: The recommended daily dose (2 capsules per day) is based on the dosages used for each strain in their respective clinical trial, which demonstrated the conferred benefits. Therefore, there is no need to adjust the dose based on body size or weight. ]
[OPTIONAL ADD ON if unaware of PDS-08®: In addition, if you are searching for a pediatric product, you may be excited to know about our second consumer innovation, PDS-08® Pediatric Daily Synbiotic, which is a 2-in-1 powdered synbiotic specifically formulated for children and adolescents ages 3-17. If interested, you may learn more here.]
Who can take PDS (age based - older)
While PDS-08® Pediatric Daily Synbiotic was formulated for ages 3-17, PDS-08® is generally safe and suitable to take as an adult as well. That said, we are unable to say for certain whether or not PDS-08® will confer the same benefits for adults, as our strains and their respective dosages were selected based on clinical data in children and adolescents.
For context, the probiotic strains in PDS-08® have a long history of research, and many of them have also been studied in adult populations for various features to improve digestive and systemic health. In addition, PDS-08® also includes the addition of prebiotic fibers, inulin and FOS—two functional ingredients with robust clinical data in humans, regardless of age. Prebiotic dietary fibers act as sources for fermentation pathways in the colon, supporting the growth of beneficial bacteria, and promoting digestive function.
﻿
[OPTIONAL ADD ON if asked about what PDS-08® is: For context, PDS-08® is a clinically studied 2-in-1 powdered probiotic + prebiotic. It is formulated with 9 clinically studied probiotic strains and a dual-phase, fiber-based prebiotic comprised of inulin and FOS. This formulation is paired with innovations in probiotic stabilization, stability and precision release to deliver strains to the lower small intestine to support gut and systemic benefits, including digestive, skin, and respiratory health.]
﻿
[OPTIONAL ADD ON if asked mentioning difficulty swallowing: As PDS-08® is a powdered delivery system, it is intended to be mixed with cold food or drink for consumption, which you may find more tolerable for your unique ecosystem.]
﻿
[OPTIONAL ADD ON to address need to adjust dose for an adult: [In terms of dosage kindly note / Kindly note] we have not conducted studies to obtain clinical data in adults at a higher dose, so we can not comment on the most efficacious dose for those 18+. Knowing this, we would suggest starting with one sachet a day (the recommended dosage for ages 3-17) for a week or so, see how you feel, and adjust if you feel it’s necessary.]
Who can take PDS (age - younger)
We are unable to recommend administering PDS-08® Pediatric Daily Synbiotic to infants and toddlers under the age of 3, as our product (both probiotic and prebiotic ingredients) was specifically formulated for and studied in children and adolescents ages 3-17. For some background, the benefits for probiotics depend on both strain and dose, and that combination must be studied in the desired cohort for both efficacy and tolerability. As our product was not formulated for, or studied in a cohort under the age of 3, we cannot comment on any difference in effect or safety/tolerability in this population. In addition, the dose of our prebiotic fiber was carefully selected for tolerability in ages 3-17. If you are interested in trying PDS-08® for your young child, we would suggest discussing this with your pediatrician who is best able to advise on the utility with the knowledge of your child’s health history.
﻿
[OPTIONAL ADD-ON for background on seeding + steady-state: It may be helpful to begin first with some background on the microbiome and the way in which it is developed, before delving further into your question.
Based on scientists’ current understanding, the first microbes babies are exposed to are their biological mother's through birth (though placental transfer is being studied), and the further development of their microbiomes continues through early infancy based on diet and a range of other factors—this is achieved through a process called "seeding". This process is an essential part of early biological development, and it continues to be influenced by the environment—nature, family members, friends, and pets can all contribute to your microbial mosaic.
Further, around age 3, the gut microbiota tends to essentially "stabilize”, reaching what scientists refer to as the "steady-state microbiome”, meaning that significant change is not intended to occur from that point forward (other than the anticipated fluctuations due to changes in diet, medication, environment, etc). It is for this reason that we formulated our own pediatric probiotic (PDS-08® Pediatric Daily Synbiotic) for children ages 3 and up, to prevent any potential disruption to the process of seeding already underway. ]
8. Do probiotics make you poop / cause gas / nausea / other digestive symptoms


Acclimation - common symptoms
To start, you may find it reassuring to note that within the first few weeks of use, it can be normal to experience some mild gastrointestinal discomfort while first acclimating to a new and potent probiotic, such as DS-01®. In fact, an immediate physiological reaction is a sign that our probiotics are viable and attuning to your system as they move through your gastrointestinal tract.
The reason for this may be associated with your complex ecosystem adjusting to the introduction of a newcomer (similar to any new diet, product or change), and specific effects generally include some gas/bloating, GI discomfort, or changes to your stool. For some reassurance, any discomfort typically eases within the first [few weeks/month or so] of consistent daily intake.
To help adjust more comfortably, I’ve provided a couple suggestions below, as members often find that experimenting with DS-01® intake can help ease any uncomfortable adjustment symptoms and support their acclimation journey.
[insert recommendation on remedy for acclimation: Acclimation Remedies/Suggestions—DS-01®]
[OPTIONAL ADD ON: reference our SciCare• Macro folder, General Effects Education]﻿
[OPTIONAL ADD ON if relevant: Lastly, it is important to note that if you ever feel that any effects may be adverse, we recommend consulting with a healthcare provider to determine whether or not DS-01® is right for your unique ecosystem.
[OPTIONAL ADD ON if member mentions 'other probiotic did not give me (GI discomfort)': It is also important to remember that commercial probiotics vary widely in regards to strains, dosages, and delivery systems, which together impact the amount of live bacteria delivered to the colon and any potential effects or benefits. This in mind, it is possible for acclimation experiences to differ from one commercial probiotic product to another.]
What are probiotics/DS side effects
When your complex ecosystem is adjusting to a newcomer such as a potent probiotic, it can be normal to experience some mild gastrointestinal changes (similar to any new diet, product or change).
This adjustment—which we call the ‘acclimation’ period—can include some mild GI discomfort such as gas/bloating, nausea, and changes to your stool. That said, these effects are considered normal and are generally mild, typically subsiding within the first few weeks of consistent, daily use.
[OPTIONAL ADD ON if nervous re: safety / side effects: For some added reassurance, our strains have been evaluated in over 20 pre-clinical (in vitro/mechanistic) and clinical (human) studies combined. In addition, DS-01® was well-tolerated in our double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials, with no Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) reported. For more information on these studies or to review our extensive testing and safety protocols, check out our DS-01® product page. You may also find useful information on our blog and FAQs page.]
This in mind, because each individual has an entirely unique microbial composition, whether or not an individual may experience any acclimation, or how they will experience it, can vary.
[OPTIONAL ADD ON if concerned medically: Ultimately, we always recommend consulting your healthcare provider regarding the utility of DS-01® in your routine, as they are best able to advise with your health history in mind.]
Nausea
Every body is physiologically unique, and taking DS-01® on an empty stomach may periodically result in nausea or discomfort in some individuals.
That said, members often find that this can be resolved by taking it later in the day, or alongside a bit of food. This is mind, it may be helpful to try experimenting with adjusting how you take DS-01®—[insert recommendations from Acclimation Remedies/Suggestions—DS-01®]. The most important thing is continuous daily intake, so try to find a time and method that consistently works best for you and is most easily tolerated by your body.
[insert language about taking DS-01®️ with/without food if needed].
It's also important to note that the way our bodies respond to DS-01® on a daily basis can vary depending on multiple factors—what we eat and how much, when our last meal was, and how much we are drinking, to name a few.
Importantly, if you ever feel that any effects may be adverse, we recommend consulting a physician, who can advise with the added knowledge of your unique health history.
﻿Weight modulation
While a temporary acclimation period is normal to experience when first beginning a new probiotic, any effects from this are generally confined to the gastrointestinal system and include things like changes to stool patterns, or mild GI discomfort, for example.
That said, aside from some temporary and mild bloating or increased gas during acclimation, kindly note that weight [gain / loss] is not an anticipated effect of probiotic use.


{ALT OPTION} Of note, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied for its effects on weights specifically; therefore, we are unable to comment on any difference in effect or utility within this population. That said, we'd be happy to share the literature surrounding probiotics and weight modulation.
Though the relationship between the microbiome and weight management is not clearly defined, there is certainly a great deal of exciting research that is being conducted to explore how metabolism and energy homeostasis are impacted by the microbiome as a whole—and how supplements such as probiotics and synbiotics can be leveraged to help promote weight loss.
Additional add-on options to weight, if particular to medication—
Semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy) / Tirzepatide (Mounjaro)
Semaglutide [or other GLP-1 receptor agonist] is the active ingredient found in Wegovy® or Ozempic®.
For some context, GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) work by slowing your digestion—more specifically, by slowing your gastric emptying rate (the speed at which substances leave the stomach after ingestion)—to help you feel less hungry.
With this in mind, it is possible that DS-01® may be released at a varied rate in the GI tract under semaglutide's influence, though we cannot say with certainty without having conducted studies to that end.
Additionally, medications like GLP-1 RAs can sometimes have side effects that impact digestion (like nausea or changes in stool patterns) as your body acclimates to them. If these ever become uncomfortable, you can try temporarily adjusting your DS-01® intake to see if this helps, starting with dropping down to one capsule until you feel ready to proceed back up to two.
Ultimately, we recommend keeping track of how you're feeling and any gastrointestinal changes you may be experiencing. We also suggest having an informed discussion with your healthcare provider, as they are able to advise in regards to your medication + supplement regimen within the context of your unique medical history.
[ALT (tirzepatide/Mounjaro): As you are likely aware, tirzepatide—the active ingredient in [Mounjaro®/Zepbound®]— works by slowing your digestion​. More specifically, it works by slowing your gastric emptying rate (the speed at which substances leave the stomach after ingestion)—to help you feel less hungry. With this in mind, it is possible that DS-01® may be released earlier in the GI tract under tirzepatide's influence, though we cannot say with certainty without having conducted studies to that end. ]
ALT for appetite / hunger
[OPTIONAL: intro to gut-brain axis: Recently, although a relatively new field of study, there is research on the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the brain—known as the “gut-brain axis”—whereby the two influence each other through biochemical signaling. This axis has most notably been connected to cognition and mood disorders. ]
It is hypothesized that through this gut-brain axis, probiotics may have an effect on appetite. However, current research is highly variable. For example, one study found probiotic supplementation improved appetites for patients with depression. However, research also identifies that acetate, the main SCFA produced by bacteria in many probiotic products, suppresses appetite. Nonetheless, a third study​ found that probiotics have minimal effects on appetite-related hormones. ​Thus, this field is still developing and more studies are needed to clarify the role of probiotics in appetite and hunger. Additionally, it is important to note that this variability may be in part because benefits for probiotic organisms are assessed at strain and dosage level, and therefore, impact of the organisms ultimately differs greatly depending on the specific strains used.
Though the relationship between the microbiome and appetite is not clearly defined, there is certainly a great deal of exciting research that is being conducted to explore how insulin sensitivity and hormones, and other factors related to appetite management, are impacted by the microbiome as a whole—and how supplements such as probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics can be leveraged to help promote appetite control.
ALT for eating disorders


To start, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied in individuals living with eating disorders specifically; therefore, we are unable to comment on any difference in effect or utility within these populations. In addition, DS-01® is not considered or regulated as a therapeutic and is therefore not intended to treat or prevent any condition or disease state.
For context, DS-01® is formulated to support multiple markers of digestive and systemic health to reinforce a healthy overall gastrointestinal system and provide core benefits to gut barrier integrity, immune health, cardiovascular health, micronutrient synthesis and dermatological health. Research demonstrates strains in DS-01® promote healthy regularity, ease of occasional digestive discomforts, improvement in intestinal environment, and a balanced gut microbiome.
Based on the research available to us today, we know that the gut microbiome is a major regulator of feeding and appetitive behaviors, as well as mental health, through diverse pathways and mechanisms (now identified as the 'gut-brain axis'). To date, there has been quite a bit of growing clinical research on probiotics' effect on feeding and eating disorders, particularly concerning how the gut microbiota may perpetuate disordered eating behaviors, or make weight regain difficult. Some research investigates the relationship between microbiota and the genetics of individuals with eating disorders.
All said, as with any supplement, individual responses to probiotics can and do vary, and therapies for feeding and eating disorders issues are constantly evolving and certainly not a 'one size fits all' solution. As such, it may be pertinent to consult with your personal physician who can advise on your probiotic and supplement routine within the context of your complete medical history.
ALT blood sugar diabetes
Since diabetes mellitus is a multifactorial disorder, the precise mechanism of action for any specific anti-diabetic effects of probiotics have not been fully established.
That said, it is thought that alterations in glucose homeostasis are associated with low-grade inflammation promoted by gut microbiota–derived endotoxins. There is a growing body of literature to support differences in the host gut microbiome of insulin-resistant individuals compared to a healthy counterpart—one study found not only bacteria associations, but also gut microbial metabolite associations in insulin resistance compared to insulin sensitivity. Research has demonstrated that imbalances in the composition and function of the intestinal bacteria can lead to blood glucose irregularities, thereby increasing the risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
A recent meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials suggested that administration of probiotics appears to have a beneficial role in the management of Type 2 diabetes; however, more rigorous clinical studies with larger sample sizes are required to develop strain-specific applications and treatment guidelines.


Diarrhea
To begin, there are many factors which may contribute to the quality of our bowel movements—including what we eat, what we drink, what medications we’re taking, how stressed we are, how well we’re sleeping, how much we exercise, and pre-existing medical conditions.
This in mind, it may be useful to consider modulating some of these factors to support [more optimal bowel movements / a more comfortable acclimation period]. While [your / your child’s] routine may already be checking all of these boxes, we like to provide a gentle reminder to ensure we are providing you [and your family] with as much support as possible.
[OPTIONAL ADD-ON: For instance, including dietary fiber in your diet may support stool regularity and consistency. It is also important to ensure you are adequately hydrated, as there may be increased expulsion of fluids.]
[FOR CHILDREN: Some sources encourage the short-term implementation of the BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast) for children, as these foods are easy on the stomach and contain dietary fibers (which have been shown to reduce the duration of liquid stools). It is also important to ensure adequate hydration when experiencing diarrhea, as your child may experience increased expulsion of fluids.]
Note for chronic diarrhea
﻿Intestinal motility is a complex process that is regulated by synchronous involvement of the neural and immune systems, gut secretions, the gut microbiota, and their metabolites—and can be influenced by a shift in any of these components. Diarrhea, can result from a variety of causes such as viral/bacteria infections, parasites, food allergies, bowel conditions such as IBS or IBD, or even psychological stressors. The gut’s robust systemic connections mean that increased motility could also be related to other conditions such as hyperthyroidism, or general immunosuppression. Extended cases of watery stool from hypermotility can also result in additional issues such as malnutrition or dehydration as the fecal material is not retained long enough for the intestines to absorb important dietary components.
Acute viral or bacteria infections are a common source of persistent diarrhea—and the associated dysbiosis of the intestinal ecosystem may cause diarrheal symptoms to persist even after the infection has cleared from the system. This may be further aggravated by the therapeutic use of drugs to treat the offending organisms such as antibiotics or antiparasitics, which are known to significantly disturb the ecosystem of the gut microbiome.
﻿Antidiarrheal medicines and rehydration solutions are common therapies to help with issues of diarrhea, alongside treatment regimens to address the cause of the condition. The microbiome-modulating effects of probiotics has led to hope for their potential use as an alternative therapy for several of the underlying conditions that can lead to diarrhea.
Interestingly, one of our strains has been studied in individuals that were carriers of a certain pathogenic bacteria in their microbiome that has been suggested to be associated with acute and persistent diarrheal disease with positive effects on reducing the cell number of the pathogenic bacteria. Additionally, several of the strains in DS-01™️ have been shown to significantly improve multiple markers of digestive health including intestinal transit time, bloating, discomfort and improved stool consistency.
﻿
[optional add-on, if the question is in relation to our product: DS-01® Daily Synbiotic was formulated with a wide variety of strains selected to support overall digestive health, which may help support bowel movement consistency. Several of the strains in DS-01® have been shown to significantly improve multiple markers of gastrointestinal function—including intestinal bloating, discomfort, and improved stool consistency and quality.
It is important to note that as with any supplement, individual responses to probiotics can and do vary—your experience will be unique to you. We would also recommend consulting a primary care provider when adding a new product to your regimen (including ours), as they may best advise on appropriate therapeutics given your health history.]
Bloating/gas
There are many factors which may contribute to the functioning of your digestive system, including diet, hydration, physical activity, medication use, stress, sleep, and pre-existing medical conditions, among others. For example, there are certain foods which may exacerbate gas and bloating, such as beans, some fruits, dairy, and even types of grains. In addition, mild physical activity can also assist in gas clearance, particularly after meals​.
In considering this, it may be useful to assess these additional factors and any potential contribution toward the discomfort experienced from [gas / bloating] [to support a more comfortable acclimation period. That said, any acclimation symptoms generally self-resolve within a few weeks of consistent daily intake.]
Finally, if the [gas / bloating] appears to be adversely affecting [you / your child], it may be useful to consider a discussion with your physician who may advise with [your / your child’s] unique constitution and health history in mind.
ALT for general relationship between microbiome + gas
 It can be normal to experience a temporary acclimation period of mild GI discomfort when first adjusting to a new probiotic like DS-01®––e.g., changes to flatulence or stool. Any discomfort is usually mild and eases within the first few weeks of consistent daily intake, and may be a sign our probiotics are viable and attuning to your system. That said, many factors contribute to the odor of our farts or stool, though it's generally thought sulfur-containing compounds make our farts smell truly heinous [1]. Interestingly, labeling them as "deadly" may be more accurate than you think––some scientists have found some of these sulfide gases can "choke out" certain harmful bacteria in our intestines [2]! To learn more check out our article on the benefits of fart walks: https://seed.com/cultured/fart-walks-science/ 💩
[1 ] https://seed.com/cultured/poop-faqs/
[2] https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33453153/
While we can't say for sure what's happening in your tummy to cause the gnarly smells (again, there are many contributing factors), lower concentrations of hydrogen sulfide may keep some of the bacterial bad guys in your gut in check and contribute to gut repair and metabolism. However, too much of these gases can also damage the mucus lining of the intestine or hinder cellular energy production [1]. To preserve this delicate balance, it's best to just let 'em rip (maybe on a fart walk). Let us know if you have more questions! 💨 🌱

9. Digestive enzymes vs. probiotics


It would be safe to take DS-01® Daily Synbiotic alongside other supplements including a digestive enzyme. In regards to timing, it may be prudent to take them separately.
For context, there is some ﻿in vitro﻿ research to suggest that digestive enzymes and bile salts may disrupt the cell structure and viability of probiotic organisms; however, this has not been shown in a human study. In addition, our probiotics are safely housed inside an inner capsule, surrounded by the prebiotic formulation and the outer capsule; therefore, it should be protected from interacting with the digestive enzymes. That said, while it is unlikely for there to be any interference, you could take them separately (i.e., 30 minutes apart) for extra precaution.
[OPTIONAL ADD ON if they're asking about the difference between the two / 'would it be redundant to take both?': For further context, digestive enzymes are usually plant-based compounds that help your body break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins from food. Probiotics are live microorganisms that provide a specific benefit to the host (humans) and prebiotics are utilized by gut microbes to produce certain metabolites. As such, probiotics/prebiotics and digestive enzymes carry separate properties and serve separate functions and it is your personal choice (with any guidance from your primary care team) on whether or not a supplemental digestive enzyme may be appropriate or beneficial for you.]
All said, we would also suggest consulting with your health care provider to determine the best course of action regarding your supplement routine.
Version 2 (deeper explanation)
It would be safe to take DS-01® Daily Synbiotic alongside other supplements including a digestive enzyme.
For context, there is some ﻿in vitro﻿ research to suggest that digestive enzymes and bile salts may disrupt the cell structure and viability of probiotic organisms; however, this has not been shown in a human study.
Interestingly, researchers now know that probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium have intrinsic resistance mechanisms to cope with digestive factors like bile salts.
In addition, our probiotics are safely housed inside an inner capsule, surrounded by the prebiotic formulation and the outer capsule; therefore, it should be protected from interacting with the digestive enzymes.
While it is unlikely for there to be any interference, to be prudent you could take them separately (ex: 30 minutes apart) for extra precaution.
[OPTIONAL ADD ON: CAN IT REPLACE MY DIGESTIVE ENZYME SUPPLEMENT? : Do note, DS-01® falls under a different supplement category than a digestive enzyme, and it is not intended to replace this, or any other supplement. To learn more about the differences between probiotics + digestive enzyme supplements, you can read more here.]
All said, we would also suggest consulting with your health care provider to determine the best course of action regarding your supplement routine.
Version 3 (deepest + most scientific)
It would be safe to take DS-01® Daily Synbiotic alongside other supplements including a digestive enzyme.
While digestive enzymes and bile salts may disrupt the membrane of probiotic organisms, it does not appear that digestive enzyme supplementation has been shown to impact the benefits of concurrent use of probiotics in a human study.
Interestingly, researchers now know that probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium have intrinsic resistance mechanisms to cope with digestive factors like bile salts.
In addition, our probiotics are safely housed inside an inner capsule, surrounded by the prebiotic formulation and the outer capsule; therefore, it should be protected from interacting with the digestive enzymes.
While it is unlikely for there to be any interference, to be prudent you could take them separately (ex: 30 minutes apart) for extra precaution.
[CAN IT REPLACE MY DIGESTIVE ENZYME SUPPLEMENT? : Do note, however, DS-01® falls under a different supplement category than a digestive enzyme, and it is not intended to replace one, or any digestive enzymes or other supplement(s).
For some added education, digestive enzymes are compounds derived from either plant, animal, or synthetic origin that help your body break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins from food.
Probiotics, on the other hand, are live microorganisms that provide a specific benefit to the host (humans), and prebiotics are utilized by gut microbes to produce certain metabolites. Synbiotics, specifically, are defined loosely as a combination of probiotics and prebiotics, or more specifically, “a mixture, comprising live microorganisms and substrates selectively utilized by host microorganisms, that confers a health benefit on the host.”
For example, DS-01® is a 2-in-1 prebiotic and probiotic that combines 24 select bacterial strains and a new class of non-fermenting prebiotic compound—punicalagins sourced from Indian Pomegranate. For reference, you can find our complete strain list and included ingredients here.

All said, we would also suggest consulting with your health care provider to determine the best course of action regarding your supplement routine.
10. Do probiotics expire


[basic Care macro]: DS expiration
Your first order of DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has guaranteed shelf stable potency when stored at temperatures of up to 79°F (26°C); the exact expiration date is printed on the bottom of the jar. Be sure to keep your jar tightly sealed and with the original desiccant packets inside.
Optional, if member specifically asks about WK expiration window: This glass jar is designed to provide the highest level of protection while using sustainable materials. It creates a robust barrier against oxygen and moisture, ensuring the contents remain fresh for up to 24 months.
Each refill pouch also has an expiration date printed on it, and should be stored at ambient temperatures and sealed until you're ready to fill up your jar again.
Optional, if member specifically asks about Refill expiration window: These pouches help reduce waste, as they're designed for easy replenishment and can be industrially composted. Due to their lighter material they have an 18-month shelf life, and with your glass jar they're the perfect system to keep your DS-01® at its freshest. 
Lyophilization
Probiotics such as DS-01® go through a process called lyophilization—a method of preserving a wide variety of heat-sensitive materials, akin to “freeze-drying”. This means that the probiotic organisms enter into an inert state until they come into contact with water, at which point they rehydrate to become active.
﻿
[OPTIONAL ADD-ON for a more detailed explanation: First, the probiotics are completely frozen before being placed under a vacuum to decrease the pressure. Then, heat energy is added, causing the ice to undergo sublimation (which is when a solid changes directly to a vapor without first going through a liquid phase). During this process, more than 95% of water is removed and “dries” the probiotics. This means that the probiotic organisms enter into an inert state, until they come into contact with water, and rehydrate to become active.]
﻿
[OPTIONAL ADD-ON to answer, but why lyophilization?: Lyophilization and cryopreservation are two commonly used methods of bacterial preservation. While cryopreservation is a great method for preservation, it requires storage in ultra-low temperatures (below -130C). Lyophilization does not require any special equipment for storage, and allows for long-term storage at room temperature. Lyophilized bacteria can also be used immediately after rehydration without any additional steps. These characteristics allow for preservation during transport/storage, shelf stability in room temperature, and “activation” by rehydration (i.e. ingesting the capsule!).]




11. Do probiotics need to be refrigerated


[Care macro - basic versions]: 
No refrigeration is necessary for DS-01® Daily Synbiotic—you can simply store your capsules at room temperature in the glass jar provided in your Welcome Kit. For context, though many probiotics are sold in the refrigerated section at grocery stores and other retailers, refrigeration doesn’t necessarily indicate “freshness” or superiority. In fact, if a probiotic does not survive at ambient temperature outside of the refrigerator, it can reflect weak stability of the product, low viable organism count, or inadequate overages in formulation. If your home is warmer than room temperature (79° F / 26° C) for extended periods, we suggest storing your DS-01® in the refrigerator to maintain viability.
No refrigeration is necessary for PDS-08® Pediatric Daily Synbiotic—you can simply store your sachets inside the aluminum BacTrac™ Container provided in your Welcome Kit. For context, though many probiotics are sold in the refrigerated section at grocery stores and other retailers, refrigeration doesn’t necessarily indicate “freshness” or superiority. In fact, if a probiotic does not survive at ambient temperature outside of the refrigerator, it can reflect weak stability of the product, low viable organism count, or inadequate overages in formulation. If your home is warmer than room temperature (>79° F / 26° C) for extended periods, we suggest storing your PDS-08® sachets in the refrigerator to maintain viability.
[Care macro]: will DS be safe if shipped in cold temps?
The strains in DS-01® Daily Synbiotic remain stable when exposed to a wide variety of shipping and weather conditions. In fact, freezing and below freezing temperatures help keep the bacteria in an ideal state. Standard recommendations for long-term storage of bacterial cultures range from -4ºF all the way down to -321ºF, so rest assured your DS-01® shouldn't be negatively impacted.
In addition, our probiotics go through a process called lyophilization; this method is akin to freeze drying and preserves certain heat-sensitive materials. The probiotic organisms enter an inert state until they come into contact with water, at which point they rehydrate to become active.
With all this in mind, one optional recommendation is to briefly "thaw" your DS-01® in the fridge to ease the transition from freezing temperatures to room temperature. Be sure to keep it in its container, since fridges can be humid and our probiotics are sensitive to water. 


What happens to DS-01® if it’s refrigerated? / Why is refrigeration not recommended for your product? / Can I store them in the bathroom? / How does humidity/moisture impact the capsules?


When probiotic organisms are exposed to conditions of high humidity and/or increased moisture, such as in the [refrigerator/bathroom], this may cause them to prematurely activate, which can impact the product's efficacy and viability at the time of consumption.
For further context, the strains in our DS-01® Daily Synbiotic undergoes lyophilization—a process that preserves a wide variety of heat-sensitive materials, such as probiotics. Through this process, the probiotic organisms enter into an inert state until they come into contact with water, and rehydrate to become active.
For this reason, probiotic organisms are highly sensitive to water activity until they are ingested.
Therefore, it is a good idea to try to minimize the moisture that your capsules come into contact with by storing them in a cool dry place. Or, ensuring use of an air tight container for capsule storage if they are in placed in the refrigerator or another environment with high humidity. 
Do I need to store DS-01® with the desiccant / silica packs? [+Travel, Expiration and Re-use]


It would be advisable to store the desiccant packs in your DS-01® storage jar alongside your capsules, as the intent of the desiccant pack is to ensure a reduction in the moisture your capsules may be exposed to during storage. The number of silica packs that are included in each refill should be the perfect amount to add to your jar—we typically advise adding both, since this is the quantity the refills come with. The most important thing is to ensure your capsules are not showing any signs of excessive moisture exposure—things like clumping of the free-flowing prebiotic powder, breakdown of the outer capsule, liquid in the storage jar, etc.
[OPTIONAL ADD ON for number of silica packs to store with: In terms of the number of packs you choose to keep in the jar, there should not be any reason why additional packs (beyond 2) would impact your product. However, you may consider switching out the packs each time you receive a new refill (with those contained in the new shipment package), so you can ensure the ones in your jar are still effective at reducing moisture.]
[OPTIONAL ADD ON for effectiveness / expiration of silica packs: Regarding the effectiveness of these silica packs: there are generally no expiration dates associated with them, so they can be reused as long as there are no signs of damage to the pack, and they still appear to be doing their job. The specific period of use usually relies on how moist or humid of an environment they are being used in, which indicates how much moisture they may have absorbed over time. If you feel their effectiveness may be waning due to visible signs of moisture inside your jar, it would be best to swap out the packs for newer ones.] [OPTIONAL ADD ON for reuse of silica packs: Though we have not performed testing ourselves for re-drying, our silica packs are standard and there are lots of useful articles online which discuss how to re-use packs that have reached their maximum absorption, by first drying them out in various ways. So if interested, feel free to use a drying technique of your choice and re-use at your discretion!] 
Accidentally disposed silica pack
We generally advise storing the desiccant packs in your DS-01® storage jar with the capsules, but if you accidentally tossed it, don't worry—it should still be fine. Just make sure to your capsules + jar are stored securely in a dry place and keep them protected from humidity.
For context, the intent of the desiccant pack is to ensure a reduction in the moisture your capsules may be exposed to during storage.
Rest-assured, you will receive additional silica/desiccant packs with your following refill orders, so you may add them back to your jar in the future.
The most important thing is to ensure your capsules are not showing any signs of excessive moisture exposure—things like clumping of the free-flowing prebiotic powder, breakdown of the outer capsule, liquid in the storage jar, etc.


12. Fiber


DS with fiber-based supplements
Version 1 (summary / most simple)
There are no known or studied contraindications between DS-01® Daily Synbiotic and other supplements; therefore, taking DS-01® alongside a fiber-based supplement, such as [supplement name], would generally be safe.
For some context, DS-01® only contains a very small amount of fiber (<200 mg/day) through the organic rice fiber included in our formulation. As such, DS-01® is not intended to negate or reduce the need for fiber, and fiber supplementation is not expected to remove DS-01®’s positive effects.
Still, it may also be pertinent to consult with your physician, who can advise on the entirety of your supplement routine with your complete health history in mind.
﻿Version 2 (deeper explanation)
There are no known or studied contraindications between DS-01® Daily Synbiotic and other supplements; therefore, taking DS-01® alongside a fiber-based supplement, such as [supplement name], would generally be safe.
For some context, DS-01® only contains a very small amount of fiber (<200 mg/day) through the organic rice fiber included to prevent the clumping of the powdered probiotic components during manufacturing. As such, DS-01® is not intended to negate or reduce the need for fiber, and fiber supplementation is not expected to remove DS-01®’s positive effects.
For reference, the National Institute of Health recommends a daily fiber intake of 25 grams for women and 38 grams for men.
That said, the concurrent intake of probiotics and soluble fibers, such as inulin, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), pectin, and psyllium may lead to heightened fermentation by probiotic bacteria, potentially causing gastrointestinal upset in some individuals. Therefore, it may be prudent to space out your intake of DS-01® and your fiber supplement (e.g., DS-01® in the morning and the fiber supplement in the evening). It may also be pertinent to consult with your physician, who can advise on the entirety of your supplement routine with your complete health history in mind.
[OPTIONAL ADD ON for Why do I need a prebiotic/synbiotic product if I supplement fiber?: There are different types of prebiotics with different mechanistic functions. For example, fermenting fibers like inulin and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) “feed” microbes and encourage growth. By contrast, our Microbiota-Accessible Polyphenolic Precursor [MAPP] introduces plant-based, non-fermenting prebiotic compounds called punicalagins, which neither inhibit nor support the growth of resident microbes. Instead, they extend their benefits as gut microbes biotransform them into metabolites—that is, beneficial and bioactive molecules often used systemically. Therefore, consuming a variety of prebiotic compounds offers an array of benefits and spurs various microbial functions.]
Psyllium husk / Metamucil 
Version 1 (summary / most simple)
There are no known interactions between probiotics like DS-01® Daily Synbiotic and other dietary supplements; therefore, DS-01® should be fine to combine with supplements, including [psyllium husk / Metamucil].
However, as [psyllium husk / Metamucil] is known to promote laxation, it is possible DS-01® capsules may eject prematurely and appear partially intact in the stool—meaning the strains may not have been adequately delivered to the colon. This in mind, we would suggest separating intake as much as possible, i.e. your [psyllium husk / Metamucil] in the morning and DS-01® in the evening, if possible.
All said, we would also suggest consulting with your health care provider to determine the best course of action regarding your supplement routine.

For context, DS-01® is not intended to negate or reduce the need for fiber, and additional fiber would not remove positive effects in DS-01®. While the FDA recommends 25g of fiber per day, research may indicate that number should be at least 40g.
﻿[OPTIONAL ADD ON to explain how psyllium husk works: Psyllium husk is a water soluble fiber that works as a 'bulking agent' to draw moisture into the stool easing defecation. It is not known to have any negative interactions with probiotic organisms—rather works to support a healthy digestive system.]

While the FDA recommends 25g of fiber per day, only an estimated 5% of US adults achieve this amount. To close the fiber gap and reap all of the benefits dietary fiber has to offer, consider aiming for more than this recommended amount–research indicates 40g.  
﻿
[OPTIONAL ADD ON to explain how psyllium husk works: Psyllium husk is a water soluble fiber that works as a 'bulking agent' to draw moisture into the stool easing defecation. It is not known to have any negative interactions with probiotic organisms—rather works to support a healthy digestive system.
In fact, a 2017 comprehensive literature review exploring randomized controlled trials on fiber supplements reports that psyllium husk (Metamucil) offers a broader range of positive benefits for cholesterol, blood glucose, and stool regularity compared to other well-researched fiber supplements, including large-particle wheat bran, guar gum, and beta-glucan from oats.]
Interestingly, while less is known about the possible, specific synergistic effects of oral probiotic and psyllium fiber supplementation specifically, a 2021 randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that psyllium husk may also elicit its’ benefits on the host due to modulation of the host microbiome.
All said, we would also suggest consulting with your health care provider to determine the best course of action regarding your supplement routine.
Best diet for the microbiome/gut / how diet supports the microbiome, how to improve/fix gut health, how to increase good bacteria
Version 1 (summary / most simple)
Interestingly, dietary intervention has been shown to have beneficial effects for both developing and maintaining a diverse microbiome. In short, eating a diet which is high in dietary fiber, primarily plant-based, and includes fermented foods, can make a positive impact on your gut microbiome. If you’re interested in learning more about how to eat with your gut microbiome in mind, check out our Cultured article, ‘Reader’s Digest: What Is the “Best” Diet for Your Gut?’.
All things considered, there is no one-size-fits-all diet, and we always encourage consulting your doctor when considering making a change to your diet, as they are best able to advise with the knowledge of your personal health history.
Version 2 (deeper explanation)
Dietary intervention has been shown to have beneficial effects for both developing and maintaining a diverse microbiome. Eating a diet which is high in dietary fiber, is primarily plant-based, and includes fermented foods, can make a positive impact on your gut microbiome.
Some specific science-backed recommendations on what to eat for your microbiome include:
* Prioritizing a diverse range of foods: different microbes feed on different dietary components!
* Including an abundance of plant-derived compounds like fiber and polyphenols: your gut microbes can transform these into metabolites, which have a range of beneficial effects on the body.
* Incorporating Omega-3 and monounsaturated fats: these healthy fats can support growth of beneficial microbes. Great sources include salmon, avocados, olive oil, chia seeds, and pumpkin seeds.
* Limiting microbiome disruptors: certain inputs (think: alcohol, sugar, preservative agents, food additives, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)) can disrupt the gut barrier and your microbes.
That said, we always encourage consulting your doctor when considering making a change to your diet, as they are best able to advise with the knowledge of your personal health history.

DETOX/ Cleanse mythbusting
Version 1 (summary / most simple)
﻿Detoxification is a naturally occurring process that the human body undergoes, wherein the biotransformation and elimination of toxic compounds occur. These processes certainly serve a vital role in the human body, as our modern environment exposes us to multitudes of toxins through air, water, food and products that may contain heavy metals, pesticides, plastics, and other pollutants.
The phrase “detox” has, in some circumstances, been co-opted into a variety of “detoxification” diets, regimens, and therapies—sometimes called “detoxes” or “cleanses”, or associated with "biohacking"—as suggested ways to remove toxins from your body, expedite detoxification pathways or promote health. Though the importance of legitimate and clinically proven detoxification should not be understated, there is limited scientific evidence to support the idea that specific detox diets or supplements are effective or necessary. Under normal circumstances, as mentioned, the body's organs are generally well-equipped to handle detoxification without the need for extreme measures.
Instead, it is generally recommended to focus on maintaining an overall healthy lifestyle, which may include a balanced and nutritious diet, staying adequately hydrated, and getting regular exercise. These practices can support the body's natural detoxification processes [1, 2, 3] and contribute to overall well-being.
Additionally, it's essential to be cautious about detox programs that involve severe dietary restrictions, extreme fasting, or the use of supplements that may lack scientific backing or could potentially be harmful. Such practices could lead to nutrient deficiencies, electrolyte imbalances, or other adverse effects.
If you have specific health concerns or conditions, it's advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before making significant changes to your diet or lifestyle. They can provide personalized advice based on your individual health needs.
[OPTIONAL ADD ON: “Detoxification” programs may involve a single process or a variety of approaches, including [XXX] as well as fasting; drinking only juices or similar beverages; restricting the intake of certain food categories; using herbs, dietary supplements, or other products; cleansing the colon (lower intestinal tract) with enemas, laxatives, or colon hydrotherapy (also called “colonic irrigation” or “colonics”); reducing environmental exposures, or using a sauna.]
﻿Version 2 (deeper explanation)
﻿Detoxification is a naturally occurring process that the human body undergoes, wherein the biotransformation and elimination of toxic compounds occur. These processes certainly serve a vital role in the human body, as our modern environment exposes us to multitudes of toxins through air, water, food and products that may contain heavy metals, pesticides, plastics, and other pollutants. Further, the consequence of inefficient elimination of said toxins can lead to accumulation in the organs and tissues—which could disrupt normal cellular function, and increase the risk of disease.
Therefore, though specific forms of health-promoting and clinically proven detoxification methods certainly have relevance, the phrase “detox” has, in some circumstances, been co-opted into a variety of diets, regimens, and therapies—sometimes called “cleanses” or associated with "biohacking"—have been suggested as ways to remove toxins from your body, or promote health when there is little scientific evidence to support their claims.
As mentioned, certain forms of detox may be useful under select specific cases and individual circumstances. This can be seen in instances where it is required to remove toxic heavy metals from the body—i.e., chelation therapy. In addition, depending on the context (for example, in the case of food intolerance or allergy), some of the above approaches may be beneficial—indeed, there’s increasing research on the possible benefits of methods such as sauna use and other complementary and alternative medical approaches for health.
In general, the research on human subjects regarding the effects of “detoxification” programs is relatively slim. While some have had positive results on weight and fat loss, insulin resistance, and blood pressure, the design of many of these studies is often poor, with few participants, not representative of the population at large, or are lacking in peer review (evaluation by other experts to ensure quality).
In fact, one 2015 review concluded that there was no compelling research to support the use of “detox” diets, specifically, for the use of eliminating toxins from the body, or even weight management. If used for the intended purpose of weight loss, a “detox” diet may assist with this by reducing body stores of glycogen, severely restricting caloric intake, or altering electrolyte balance (all of which can be dangerous), but will inevitably lead to weight regain once a person resumes a normal diet. At this time, we are not aware of studies observing the long-term effects of “detoxification” programs.
On the topic of safety, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have taken action against several companies selling detox/cleansing products because they either contained illegal, potentially harmful ingredients; were marketed using false claims that they could treat serious diseases; or, in the case of medical devices used for colon cleansing, were marketed for unapproved uses.
For example, juices used in popular detox or cleanse products may not be suitable for individuals with select health conditions which require appropriately planned diets. Subsisting on liquids alone can disrupt the body’s normal electrolyte balance, and diets that place severe restrictions on quantity or variety of foods may not provide all necessary nutrients for proper function and health.
Instead, it is generally recommended to focus on maintaining an overall healthy lifestyle—including a balanced and nutritious diet (which may vary, depending on the individual), staying adequately hydrated, and getting regular exercise. These practices can support the body's natural detoxification processes [1, 2, 3] and contribute to overall well-being.
Additionally, it's essential to be cautious about detox programs that involve severe dietary restrictions, extreme fasting, or the use of supplements that may lack scientific backing or could potentially be harmful. Such practices could lead to nutrient deficiencies, electrolyte imbalances, or other adverse effects.
If you have specific health concerns or conditions, it's advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before making significant changes to your diet or lifestyle. They can provide personalized advice based on your individual health needs.

[COLON CLEANSE / ENEMA SPECIFIC: Though there has been much interest in colon cleansing for the promotion of detoxification and general health, in fact, colon cleansing for such purposes may not be necessary.

["BINDER" SPECIFIC: Most binders (e.g. clays, activated charcoal) have been studied in the context of mycotoxin removal in feed for livestock​ and poultry​. The majority of studies in humans involve aflatoxins​, which affect many countries in Africa, especially in Kenya. The primary method for solving this issue involves treating the livestock feed or the food before it reaches consumers—not necessarily giving these "binders" to people directly.
Additionally, although some of these binders do have genuine uses for acute poisoning, these are heavily dose dependent. Most supplements contain these ingredients at the milligram level when their "effective dose" may be much higher.

[OPTIONAL ADD ON / RESEARCH REGARDING FOODS / NUTRIENTS: With the continued emergence of data supporting the role of toxins in chronic disease processes, some would argue for the importance of understanding the role of various therapeutic modalities that have the potential to reduce toxin load in patients. While the inclusion of certain foods or nutrients may be helpful, the science of how they may work to detoxify is further complicated by the fact that there exists biphasic responses in their mechanism of action—i.e., at varying doses, certain detoxification enzymes may be actively inhibited or induced. Further, these nutrients and foods may act synergistically or in opposition to one another. Also, the efficacy of these nutrients or foods may be finite, and adapt over time.
One 2015 review provides an overview of the numerous foods and food-based nutrients which may influence the systems of detoxification. Still, one of the limitations that comes to the fore is that this research is constrained primarily to cell or animal-based research, and may not bare out in humans. Further, it’s worth considering the role that the totality of an individual’s lifestyle may have on induction or inhibition of natural detoxification processes—for example, smoker/non-smoker status, physical activity, or stress. All of these factors have both an individual and collective impact on an individual’s health and resilience to bodily insults.]
Version 3 (deepest + most scientific)
SciCare Note: Can reference [ Process of Liver Detox ] for further understanding / expansion
﻿Detoxification is a naturally occurring process that the human body undergoes, wherein the biotransformation and elimination of toxic compounds occur. These processes certainly serve a vital role in the human body, as our modern environment exposes us to multitudes of toxins through air, water, food and products that may contain heavy metals, pesticides, plastics, and other pollutants. Further, the consequence of inefficient elimination of said toxins can lead to accumulation in the organs and tissues—which could disrupt normal cellular function, and increase the risk of disease.
Though the importance of legitimate, bodily-enacted detoxification should not be understated, the phrase “detox” has, in some circumstances, been co-opted by the industry of wellness in order to market and sell supplements, products, and protocols. A variety of “detoxification” diets, regimens, and therapies—sometimes called “detoxes” or “cleanses”—have been suggested as ways to remove toxins from your body, or promote health when there is limited scientific evidence to support the idea that specific detox diets or supplements are necessary or effective for improving health.
﻿
[OPTIONAL ADD ON: “Detoxification” programs may involve a single process or a variety of approaches, including [XXX] as well as fasting; drinking only juices or similar beverages; restricting the intake of certain food categories; using herbs, dietary supplements, or other products; cleansing the colon (lower intestinal tract) with enemas, laxatives, or colon hydrotherapy (also called “colonic irrigation” or “colonics”); reducing environmental exposures, or using a sauna.]
Under select specific cases and individual circumstances, forms of detox may be useful. For example, in instances where it is required to remove toxic heavy metals from the body—i.e., chelation therapy. In addition, depending on the context (for example, in the case of food intolerance or allergy), some of the above approaches may be beneficial—indeed, there’s increasing evidence of possible benefits of fasting, sauna use, and other complementary and alternative medical approaches for health (which may use specific herbs or supplements or contemplative mindfulness practices), all of which may be used as part of a “detox protocol.”
That said, the research on human subjects regarding the effects of “detoxification” programs is relatively scant. While some have had positive results on weight and fat loss, insulin resistance, and blood pressure, the design of many of these studies is often poor, with few participants, not representative of the population at large, or are lacking in peer review (evaluation by other experts to ensure quality).

[COLON CLEANSE / ENEMA SPECIFIC: Diving deeper into colon cleanses as a specific example—though there has been much interest in colon cleansing for the promotion of detoxification and general health, in fact, colon cleansing for such purposes may not be necessary since your digestive system already eliminates waste material and bacteria from your body. Colon cleansing is traditionally reserved for use prior to preparing for certain medical procedures, such as a colonoscopy.

Additionally, this striking case report outlined the occurrence of 36 cases of amebiasis (a parasitic disease) in individuals who had undergone colonic-irrigation therapy due to the machine being heavily contaminated with fecal bacteria. This finding raises the importance of having sterile equipment and a robust protocol prior to undergoing such a procedure.

Gut testing
Version 1 (summary / most simple)
Individuals often want to know what a healthy microbiome looks like. However, this type of question is one that still evades microbiome scientists due to a variety of reasons.
In order to answer your inquiry, we must first discuss some important concepts in the field of microbiome science.
To start, in 2007, the National Institute of Health spearheaded a $173 million Human Microbiome Project (HMP) with the goal of characterizing the human microbiome and to determine if changes in microbiome composition could be correlated with health and disease.
The overarching goal of the HMP was to understand the range of genetic and physiological diversity that can exist within a human microbiome [OPTIONAL EXTENSION here: as well as the factors that could affect its distribution and evolution. From there, the data of the HMP could be used to identify new ways to determine microbiome-related disease susceptibility and possible treatment strategies.]
The HMP encompassed five years of research and over 200 scientists—it concluded in 2012, finding that in fact, there is no universally healthy microbiome! That said, what this study did reveal is that the metabolic function of your microbiome, rather than what microbial species are present there, is of importance (translation: it can be more important what your bacteria are doing, rather than ‘who’ they are).
In addition, there are substantial limitations with using microbiome testing kits, especially when detecting the presence of symbiotic organisms. These tests can have high levels of inter-day variability, and take a small subsection of stool that may not be representative of the colonic microbiota.
With this in mind, not only do these tests have apparent constraints based on the sampling methods—but science is also not yet at the point in which we have concretely defined what a ‘healthy’ microbiome looks like (as this can vary based on the individual), so the actionable insights from these tests can be limited.
That said, diagnostic tests are certainly still useful tools for specific endpoints beyond understanding whether one’s microbiome is ‘healthy’, such as in understanding and helping to diagnose bacterial vaginosis, or to understand how the body metabolizes glucose.
So, while we encourage consumers to enjoy participating in citizen science, it is also important to note that there could be limitations with using certain diagnostic tools based on where the science is today. We’d always encourage individuals to garner any specific insights from this testing with a personal physician.

The HMP encompassed five years of research and over 200 scientists. It concluded in 2012, finding that in fact, there is no universally healthy microbiome! However, the HMP did reveal that what’s most important is the metabolic function of your microbiome, rather than what microbial species are present there (translation: it’s much more important what your bacteria are doing, rather than who they are).
To dive deeper, there are a few reasons why measuring a healthy microbiome can be challenging—all of which are discussed in great detail in the 2018 workshop “Can We Begin to Define a Healthy Gut Microbiome Through Quantifiable Characteristics?”, where 40+ academic, government, and industry experts convened for discussion.
Some relevant conclusions were as follows:
* Mechanistic links of specific changes in gut microbiome structure with markers of human health are not yet established
* Microbiome communities are highly individualized & show a high degree of inter-individual variation to perturbation
* Static genetic sampling misses important short- and long-term microbiome-related dynamic changes to host health
In relation to gut tests in particular, there can be substantial limitations with using microbiome testing kits, especially when detecting the presence (measured as relative abundance) of symbiotic organisms.
In fact, numerous studies (1, 2, 3) have shown that the microbiome composition of your GI tract actually varies significantly from your stool. A snapshot of your stool microbial composition does not accurately tell us what’s happening in the gut, as a small subsection of stool may not be representative of the colonic microbiota.
Additionally, the consistency of stool can determine how readable the sample is–and this is something that can vary widely, even in one person, from day to day.
Lastly, there can also be day to day variation as your GI tract encounters foreign substances including food, medicine, and nutrients. Many of these things can end up in the stool which may impact the results when a small subsection is utilized.
[OPTIONAL ADD ON relating to use of personalized probiotics / why probiotics did not show up in gut test: Further, taking the results from these tests to inform probiotic supplementation regimens can be misleading. This is because probiotics are transient microbes (they travel through your intestines to deliver health benefits), and outside of specific cases like a fecal microbiota transplant (FMT), most strains do not colonize the gut. In fact, research shows that probiotics organisms are no longer recoverable in stool 1–4 weeks after stopping consumption. Instead, they work by supporting overall gut health through interactions with resident microbes and local cells as they make their way through your GI tract.
As an example, scientifically-studied probiotics (like DS-01® Daily Synbiotic) take a different approach, one that looks at specific strains of beneficial bacteria which have a health benefit in humans independent of someone’s starting microbiome; and one that doesn’t intend to replace, replenish, or deplete existing gut microbes in order to work their ‘magic’.
Relating this all back to the fact that we do not yet know what a ‘healthy’ microbiome looks like, it is clear that personalizing probiotic supplementation based on these results is not necessarily evidence-backed based on current research. So, while we wish it were as simple as ‘find out what’s missing and put the good stuff back’, it’s clear that’s unfortunately not how a complex ecosystem like the human body works.]
In summary then, there is currently no way to define how your microbiome “should” be, and the brief snapshot of what’s exiting your gut at the time of sampling simply does not reflect the dynamic ecosystem existing within, nor does it provide evidence-backed, actionable insight. So while we encourage customers to enjoy participating in citizen science, it is also important to note that there could be limitations with using such diagnostic tools based on where the science is today. Thus, it may be best to garner any specific insights from this testing with your physician; and, if necessary, assess whether a probiotic supplement could be beneficial to you based on the specific benefit(s) you may be seeking.

Version 3 (deepest + most scientific)
To dive deeper, here are some reasons why measuring a healthy microbiome can be challenging:
1. The microbiome can exhibit immense diversity and complexity: The human microbiome is incredibly diverse, consisting of trillions of microorganisms—including not only bacteria, but viruses, fungi, and more. This diversity makes it challenging to identify and characterize all the different species present—so much so that still yet, scientists refer to the part of the set of unknown microorganisms occasionally referred to as “microbial dark matter” or “functional unknowns”.
2. There is a high degree of inter-individual variation: Microbiomes vary significantly from person to person. Factors such as genetics, diet, lifestyle, environment, and even birth delivery method can influence the composition of an individual's microbiome.
3. The microbiome is highly dynamic in nature: The composition of the microbiome is not static; it can change within an individual, over time, in response to various factors such as diet, medications, and environmental exposures. This dynamic nature makes it challenging to pinpoint a stable set of microbial characteristics that define a healthy state.
4. ﻿There still exist certain technological limitations: While advancements in sequencing technologies have improved our ability to analyze microbial communities, there are still limitations. Some microorganisms are challenging to culture or identify accurately, and certain functions of the microbiome are not fully understood or easily measurable with current techniques.
5. ﻿Defining function vs. composition: As mentioned, assessing the functional aspects of the microbiome (what it does) is just as important as understanding its composition (what microorganisms are present). However, functional analysis is more complex and less straightforward than identifying microbial species, making it harder to define what a "healthy" function entails.
6. ﻿Lack of Reference Standards: Unlike some medical parameters where there are clear reference ranges, defining a standard for a healthy microbiome is difficult due to the variability between individuals and populations. What may be considered healthy for one person, may not be the same for another.
7. The microbiome is intricately connected with various aspects of human health, including the immune system, metabolism, and mental health. Understanding the interactions between the microbiome and these systems adds an additional layer of nuance to defining what is considered a healthy microbiome. In fact, health effects of specific microbial signatures might well be context dependent,—i.e., some bacterial taxa may be associated with health in some circumstances, and disease in another. Akkermansia, for example, is correlated with healthier metabolic features in obese individuals and inversely with prevalence of multiple sclerosis. It might therefore be impossible to determine microbiome features that are universally healthy; what constitutes a “healthy microbiome” for one person or human population might well be unhealthy in a different context.
In summary, the challenges in measuring a healthy microbiome arise from its diversity, individual variation, dynamic nature, technological limitations, the need to assess both composition and function, and the lack of clear reference standards. Ongoing research is working to address these challenges and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the microbiome's role in human health.

13.  Alcohol


Can I drink alcohol when/while taking DS-01®?
Ethanol (alcohol) is unlikely to compromise the viability of the live organisms, so it should be fine to take your DS-01® Daily Synbiotic if you plan to consume alcohol. That said, ethanol has been shown to induce gut barrier permeability, which can negatively impact overall intestinal health.
While the research in this field is still in its infancy, some studies have suggested a potential benefit probiotics can provide in reversing alcohol-induced microbiota changes and restoring gut microbial composition post-alcohol use. At this time, we don’t know if DS-01® can help rescue ethanol-induced gut barrier permeability, but it’s an area of research we are actively exploring!
While we are unable to say for sure if it is particularly beneficial, you may consider spacing out your DS-01® intake from your alcohol consumption—i.e. taking DS-01® in the morning or afternoon if you plan to consume alcoholic beverages in the evening.
Lastly, it may be helpful to note that there is no universal "best" time of day to take DS-01®, so feel free to experiment and find what works best for your body and routine. For example, you're welcome to take the product with food (alongside breakfast, perhaps), as this would not be expected to compromise the viability of our probiotic strains.
﻿Probiotics + liver health
The field of microbiome sciences as it relates to liver health is an area of interest for many researchers—so much so that the term ‘Gut-Liver-Axis' has emerged. The Gut-Liver axis describes the reciprocal interaction between the microbiome and the liver, mediated by the portal vein which carries metabolites from the gut to the liver, and bile and antibodies from the liver to the intestine. Aside from their interactions with nuclear receptors in metabolic function regulation, bile acids also help to modulate gut microbiota.
Preliminary research indicates that disturbances of the gut microbiota (dysbiosis) can affect the liver, and probiotic-based therapies are offering encouraging results to potentially support the restoration of healthy liver function. Some preliminary research demonstrated that certain strains of probiotics could reduce liver fat, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity (a specific liver enzyme), and inflammatory markers in patients with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). Notably, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG was evaluated by researchers as a potential management tool for pediatric obesity-related liver disease through decreasing ALT levels (of note, high ALT​ is mostly associated with liver cell injury).


14. Prebiotics


What is the prebiotic in DS-01®? What are Punicalagins?


The patented prebiotic formula in DS-01® Daily Synbiotic (Microbiota-Accessible Polyphenolic Precursors™, MAPP) is a class of bioactive plant compounds (punicalagins) that are derived from the fruit and skin of Indian pomegranate. This prebiotic is a novel class of non-fermenting prebiotics, meaning unlike many commercially available prebiotics—like Fructooligosaccharide (FOS), Galactooligosaccharide (GOS), and inulin—DS-01®’s prebiotic is not fermented by your gut bacteria and is therefore considered FODMAP-diet friendly.
Further, punicalagins exert their prebiotic effect by being acted upon by specific microorganisms in the gut, producing smaller, beneficial metabolites for the body, such as ellagic acid and various urolithins. Our prebiotic has been clinically validated and shown to maintain healthy skin and support a balanced skin microbiome through the gut-skin-axis.
UROLITHIN-A OPTIONAL ADD-ON
[Optional add-on: You may be interested to know that in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial, DS-01® significantly increased Urolithin A—[a powerful molecule for healthy aging / which promotes cellular health/longevity/healthy aging]—in healthy adults, and recovery of Urolithin A in individuals experiencing occasional gut stress.
Technical audience: DS-01® is clinically validated to increase Urolithin A production in urine 1000-fold in individuals experiencing occasional gut stress (p=0.008). ]
What is the prebiotic in PDS-08®? What is Inulin and FOS?


The prebiotic formula in PDS-08® Pediatric Daily Synbiotic consists of a 50:50 blend of short-chain fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and long-chain inulin, sourced from chicory root. This contributes 5 grams of dietary fiber to each daily serving of PDS-08®.
﻿
[OPTIONAL / Extra information:
15. Inulin, expanded: Inulin is a water soluble storage polysaccharide, which belongs to a group of non-digestible carbohydrates called fructans.
16. Inulin extraction: The inulin is extracted from the chicory root by a gentle hot water extraction (i.e. they are natural plant-based dietary fibers).
17. Fermentation: This blend supports fermentation throughout the colon, as short-chain FOS is rapidly fermented in the proximal colon, while long-chain inulin ferments stably throughout the colon.
18. Glycemic-index: This prebiotic blend is non-glycemic, and, therefore, would not be expected to have an effect on blood glucose levels.
19. Nutrition Facts: The prebiotic blend in each daily serving of PDS-08® contributes 6 grams of total carbohydrates; 5 grams of dietary fiber, and less than 1 gram of sugar (0 grams of added sugars).]
How is your prebiotic different from others? 
As you may know, there are different types of prebiotics and mechanisms by which they function.
One type of prebiotics are plant-based compounds that are biotransformed by gut bacteria into beneficial metabolites for the body—meaning, it's not just about what bacteria 'eat', but also what bacteria can 'do'. These are the types of prebiotic compounds included in DS-01® Daily Synbiotic.
For additional context, our prebiotic is punicalagins, isolated and purified from Indian pomegranate. Punicalagins are an incredibly powerful polyphenol found in the fruit and skin of the pomegranate (and the compound that gives pomegranates their deep, burgundy color). Certain gut bacteria metabolize punicalagin into a powerful molecule called Urolithin A. This molecule drives a process called mitophagy, which manages the recycling of defective mitochondria in our cells, and has deep implications on metabolic health.
UROLITHIN-A OPTIONAL ADD-ON
[Optional add-on: You may be interested to know that in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial, DS-01® significantly increased Urolithin A—[a powerful molecule for healthy aging / which promotes cellular health/longevity/healthy aging]—in healthy adults, and recovery of Urolithin A in individuals experiencing occasional gut stress.
Technical audience: DS-01® is clinically validated to increase Urolithin A production in urine 1000-fold in individuals experiencing occasional gut stress (p=0.008). ]
Another type of prebiotics are substrates for gut bacteria (i.e. fiber that 'feeds' the microbes and encourage growth), which require larger amounts than can be contained in a capsule, which is why we do not include this in our product. These are carbohydrates that usually end in -oligosaccharide, and come in a variety of forms, but are most often found in food. Our recommendation is to obtain these types of prebiotic substrates from dietary sources.
While the prebiotics included in DS-01® do not feed the probiotics, they do act as part of the protective nested capsule-in-capsule technology we use in order to ensure the probiotics make it to the colon, where they do their work.


20. IBS
DS-01® is regulated by the FDA as a dietary supplement, and as such, is not intended to diagnose, treat, prevent, or cure any condition or disease state. As we are unable to comment on the utility of DS-01® with respect to specific medical states or conditions, we would suggest consulting with your physician who can appropriately advise on DS-01® administration while taking into account your complete health history.
In terms of the clinical landscape of populations with digestive challenges, research suggests that probiotics may alleviate the frequency and severity of flatulence, slow down the transit time of the colon, support bowel movement regularity, improve stool consistency, and aid a better overall quality of life.
With this in mind, DS-01® was recently the subject of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application and clinical trial at Harvard Medical School - Beth Israel Deaconess to assess its impact on individuals who experience occasional digestive challenges. Include information from: Can you tell me about the results from your clinical trial on Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)?﻿

Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) - CD, UC, MC
[Background on IBD: Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) are multifaceted, immune disorders of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are the two major clinical phenotypes of IBD. Both UC and CD involve inflammation in the GI tract with symptoms that can include diarrhea, rectal pain, abdominal pain.
UC generally is localized in the colon, whereas CD can affect any part of the GI tract (from mouth to the anus). Further, UC is a continuous, confluent inflammation of the colon, while there can be healthy portions mixed with inflamed sections of the GI tract in CD. ]
NOTE: Pouchitis is a complication from IBD surgery (ileoanal anastomosis, J-pouch surgery) — more info found in this card: Pouchitis ]
﻿GENERAL ibd (did not mention type)
As the field stands, it is inconclusive​ whether probiotics can be an effective therapeutic or intervention strategy for IBD. While there are studies examining probiotics in the context of IBD (or specifically in the clinical subtypes, ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease), majority of studies have been conducted in vitro—either in cells or in animal models. This urges the need for clinical trials in humans to better understand the efficacy of probiotics in managing IBD.
Although under the umbrella of IBD, ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) do not present the same—and thus, respond differently to the same treatment. One meta-analysis​ examining clinical trials using probiotics for UC, pouchitis, and CD patients indicated that while probiotics were beneficial for maintaining remission in UC and pouchitis patients, the same benefit was not seen in CD patients.
Therefore, while probiotics are generally safe as an adjunct therapy​ in the management of IBD, there is still a need for large samples of high-quality clinical trials to further determine the efficacy and strain-specific utility of probiotic agents in the induction and maintenance of IBD, especially CD.
Crohn's Disease
Due to the potential involvement of the gut microbiota in pathogenesis​ of Crohn's disease (CD), probiotic use is one strategy that may help with treatment of CD. While there is some research​ showing the beneficial role of probiotics in IBD (primarily ulcerative colitis), there is less regarding CD, specifically.
One meta-analysis​ examining clinical trials using probiotics for ulcerative colitis (UC), pouchitis, and CD patients indicated that while probiotics were beneficial for maintaining remission in UC and pouchitis patients, the same benefit was not seen in CD patients.
Similarly, another analysis​ found probiotics could potentially induce remission for UC, but did not present the same for CD. As the field currently stands, it seems there is no strong evidence​ that supports the use of probiotics to induce remission in CD. The research​ calls for better clinical trials with larger sample sizes to identify the strains, dosages, and duration of probiotics needed for CD treatment.
Therefore, while probiotics are generally safe to as an adjunct therapy​ in the management of IBD, there is still a need for large samples of high-quality clinical trials to further determine the efficacy and strain-specific utility of probiotic agents in the induction and maintenance of IBD, especially CD.
ULCERATIVE COLITIS
While the development of ulcerative colitis remains complex and multifactorial, the commensal microbiome has been implicated in the pathogenesis / development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC).
﻿Scientific literature indicates promising results for the use of probiotics in patients with IBD, such as decreased pain, diarrhea, bloating, gas, and mucus production. The general mechanisms include improved gut barrier integrity, balanced immune responses, and favorable changes in the levels of a number of metabolites that are associated with lowered levels of mucosal inflammation. A recent review of 36 studies found that probiotics alone or in combination with conventional therapies may improve remission rates in UC patients, along with disease severity and clinical outcomes—including rectal bleeding and stool consistency. Another systematic review found that probiotics may improve induction of clinical remission in UC patients compared to placebo, but limited evidence to suggest that probiotics are superior to 5-ASA (a treatment standard).
microscopic colitis
[Background on MC: Microscopic colitis is another subtype of IBD, characterized by chronic watery diarrhea and diagnosed through histology of the colon. Microscopic colitis has two subtypes, collagenous colitis or lymphocytic colitis, depending on the characteristics of the histological sample. ]
The development of microscopic colitis is not well understood, though research suggests inflammation, gut barrier, immunity, and the microbiome may all play a role.
At this time, the research surrounding probiotic supplementation for microscopic colitis is uncertain and still in its infancy—further clinical studies are needed to explore the potential role probiotics could play in the treatment and prevention of microscopic colitis, before any conclusions can be made.
[Optional Add-on: While current evidence is limited​, probiotics have been speculated​ as modulators of the gut microbiota and intestinal barrier, which may benefit lymphocytic colitis (LC) patients. ]


21. Acne
Interestingly, emerging evidence indicates that there is extensive cross-communication between the skin, its associated microbiome, and the gut microbiome. In fact, this is now referred to as the “gut-skin axis.”
However, there are many potential causes of acne and the exact relationship of the gut microbiota​ on acne, pathogenesis remains elusive. One study​ showed patients with acne had a different microbiota than those without acne—suggesting the gut microbiome dysbiosis may have an effect on acne.
Further, scientific evidence suggests that certain probiotic strains show promise as effective treatments in some inflammatory skin conditions, such as atopic dermatitis, acne vulgaris, and psoriasis.
Currently, probiotic use for acne is still not well-understood—however, research​​ regarding probiotics for acne is still developing and further studies + trials may lead to more conclusive answer. 
22. Skin (aside from other options above)


Psoriasis / Psoriatic Arthritis
[OPTIONAL gut-skin axis background:
As you may know, the gut microbiome is believed to play a role in a wide variety of skin conditions by way of the gut-skin axis—the bidirectional relationship between your gut microbes and your skin. ]
The gut microbiome is believed to play a role in psoriasis [and psoriatic arthritis] through the gut-skin axis. Current research suggests the disruption​ of the gut microbiome may play a role in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, but it’s still unclear which gut microbial species are implicated in these diseases in humans.
[If only psoriasis:
In general, individuals with psoriasis have an altered gut microbiota​ abundance and diversity when compared to controls. These alterations have also been associated with inflammation-related​ indicators—suggesting dysbiosis (disruption) in the gut microbiome may be associated with psoriasis.
In fact, a clinical trial​ found probiotic + prebiotic supplementation in conjunction with topical psoriasis treatment led to an improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index​ (PASI, one of the best clinical tools used to measure psoriasis severity) and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). However, one meta-analysis​ examining 3 trials found no significant difference in PASI scores between both probiotic and control groups.
Therefore, the efficacy of probiotic (or prebiotic) use with psoriasis is still not well-understood. As shown in the trial above, it is possible probiotics may be beneficial with current psoriasis treatment; however, further studies and trials are needed to assess the therapeutic benefit of probiotics and which strains/dosage would be effective for psoriasis. ]
﻿
[Psoriatic arthritis + probiotics: In addition, while much research has been done in cells and in mice, probiotics have had mixed results​ in interventional clinical trials in people with psoriatic arthritis. ]
[If member is taking immunosuppressants for psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis, see Immunosuppressants / Immunocompromised ]
Atopic Dermatitis (Eczema)
While [DS-01®/PDS-08®] does include strains which have been studied to support skin health and reinforce the gut-skin axis, our product has not been specifically studied in populations with eczema, so we therefore cannot comment on any specific effects in this regard.
Moreover, it is important to note that [DS-01®/PDS-08®] is regulated by the FDA as a dietary supplement, and as such, is not intended to diagnose, treat, prevent, or cure any condition or disease state. Ultimately, it is best to work with [your/your child's] healthcare provider to ensure the appropriateness of a dietary supplement (including ours!) for [your/your child’s] particular needs, due to their unique medical history and the specific benefits you’re interested in. If you’re interested, you can find a full list of our strains and ingredients here for reference in this discussion.
That said, I’d be happy to share some relevant research on eczema and probiotics in general, if that is of use.
As you may know, the gut microbiome is believed to play a role in a wide variety of skin conditions by way of the gut-skin axis—the bidirectional relationship between your gut microbes and your skin.
Current research suggests the disruption​ of the gut microbiome may play a role in eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis (AD). In general, individuals with AD tend to have lower diversity ​of gut microbiota—in particular, less Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria—potentially reducing the amount of beneficial bacterial metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)​.
[If asking about childhood AD: In fact, in adolescents, administration of a probiotic mix​​ of three Lactobacillus strains and one Bifidobacterium strain led to decreases in the SCORAD index​ (one of the best clinical tools used to measure AD severity). That said, a meta-analysis​ noted that the efficacy of probiotics on childhood AD is affected by the participant's age, the strain/dose used, and when the probiotics were administered; thus, further studies and more rigorous clinical trials are needed before a specific probiotic can be recommended for AD treatment.]
[If asking about adult AD specifically: A meta-analysis​ of six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults found that oral probiotics could significantly decrease eczema severity as measured by SCORAD index​ (one of the best clinical tools used to measure AD severity)—but did not do the same for itch severity, skin severity, quality of life, or immune response (although, these effects varied by study and strain).
Interestingly, a recent systematic review ​and meta-analysis of nine RCTs also found oral probiotics could significantly reduce short-term and long-term symptom severity in adult eczema patients (as measured by SCORAD). Further, the study found that probiotics significantly increased quality of life measures in the long term, but in the not short term. Based on network analyses, researchers also found probiotics containing Lactobacillus salivarius and Bifidobacterium to be most highly associated with positive outcomes.
With all of this in mind, more randomized controlled trials are still needed to determine the efficacy of using probiotics to treat AD in adults, as well as the optimal strains and dosages.]
Hidradenitis Suppurativa
Kindly note, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied in individuals living with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) specifically; therefore, we are unable to comment on any difference in effect or utility within this population. Further, DS-01® is not considered or regulated as a therapeutic and is therefore not intended to treat or prevent any condition or disease state.
However, I'd love to share some information from scientific literature regarding HS and the microbiome.
One study​ found patients with HS had altered skin + gut microbiomes compared to patients without HS. Due to this microbiome connection​, probiotics have been considered as a potential therapy option for HS. One article​ suggests the use of a probiotic skin application of skin commensal bacteria (Corynebacterium spp., Staphylococcus epidermidis, Cutibacterium acnes) as a prophylactic approach for pre-lesion HS.
Although probiotics have been studied in other inflammatory skin diseases​ (such as Atopic Dermatitis), there is less known about HS and probiotics. Furthermore, most research​ on HS focuses on the skin microbiome—which may lead to development of a topical probiotic. This all in mind, further studies and clinical trials are warranted to better understand the relationship of the gut microbiome + HS, in order to develop an oral probiotic for HS treatment.
23. Diverticular disease (diverticulosis, diverticulitis)
DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied concerning diverticular disease (which includes diverticulosis, as well as diverticulitis—an inflammation or infection of the abnormal pouches formed in diverticulosis) specifically, so we are unable to comment on any potential differences in effect in this regard. That said, DS-01® is generally considered safe to take among individuals with preexisting medical conditions, including diverticulosis and diverticulitis.
There have been a few studies looking at the efficacy of probiotics in the remission of diverticular abdominal symptoms. That said, the current consensus is that there is insufficient evidence as to whether probiotics can effectively reduce symptoms related to diverticulosis.
24. Acid reflux / Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)
Kindly note, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied in individuals with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) nor has the alleviation of acid reflux (heartburn) or esophageal discomfort been evaluated as an endpoint in formulating our product.
Rather, DS-01® provides support for overall healthy gut function. [OPTIONAL: include relevant DS-01® Benefits • Digestive Health]
Interestingly, research​ suggest that probiotics may be beneficial for GERD/acid reflux—participants in studies noted a decrease in dyspepsia (indigestion) or reduced reflux episodes. However, as noted in the article, more rigorous and larger studies are needed to properly determine and assess probiotic use in individuals with GERD or acid reflux.
[OPTIONAL if asking about gastric probiotic: As the gastric environment is harsh, it is difficult to examine the effects of probiotics in this environment—for context, they would likely need to release in the stomach and survive the conditions to exert effects. This is an understudied aspect of gastric research—more studies and clinical trials are warranted to confirm the true efficacy of probiotics in alleviating these symptoms.]
[OPTIONAL if asking our product releases in stomach: Due to the vulnerability of probiotic bacteria to the acidic conditions of the stomach and the bile salts in our intestines (with survival rates being 20-40%), our product is not intended to release the probiotics in the stomach. Precise delivery of probiotics is crucial to ensure they survive GI stresses and are delivered live to specific locations, along the small intestine and the colon, imparting health benefits associated with their mechanisms of action. ]


25. psychological / neurological / gut-brain axis


Gut-brain axis
I'd be happy to share more about the research landscape concerning probiotics and mental health. Science has certainly validated the knowledge that the microbiome communicates with the central nervous system via a collection of pathways now known as the gut-brain axis. Mood disorders share a close interrelationship with disordered gastrointestinal function—made evident in that intestinal distress is a commonly reported symptom in those with depression and anxiety.
Moreover, mood disorders frequently co-occur with gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, and ulcerative colitis.
Notably, probiotics have generated intensive interest in recent years as an adjunct to treatment of some mood disorders. Nevertheless, the 'antidepressant' potential of probiotics remains unclear. While preclinical and animal studies show promise in the treatment of depression, clinical research in humans has largely been underpowered or lacking.
Animal results show that the use of probiotics may lead to an increase in plasma tryptophan levels and reduced concentrations of serotonin in the frontal cortex and of cortical dopamine metabolites, thereby ameliorating depressive symptoms.
There's almost no function in the human body that bacteria aren't involved in. New findings emerge constantly, illuminating the impact our gut flora may have on depression—so much so that the term psychobiotic has emerged: live bacteria which, when ingested, confer mental health benefits.
It’s important to acknowledge that this is a very new field of study and further clinical data in humans is warranted to support probiotics as an efficacious treatment for anxiety, depression, and related mental health/psychological conditions.
On this note, you may be pleased to know that, in July of 2022, we launched a Gut-Brain Development Program​ in partnership with Axial Therapeutics to develop microbial innovations for overall mental well-being.
The program builds on the work of Axial co-founder and Seed Health Board Member  Dr. Sarkis Mazmanian and will develop next-generation probiotics and therapeutics to modulate the gut microbiota to target areas like anxiety, depression, and stress. We will share more information with our community as updates become available, so please stay tuned! In the meantime, you are always welcome to follow our product pipeline to track our progress as new innovations are developed!
Anxiety
While a temporary acclimation period is normal to experience when first beginning a new probiotic, any effects from this are generally confined to the gastrointestinal system and include things like mild changes to stool patterns, bloating or gas. This in mind, kindly note that [mood changes / anxiety] is not an effect expected of acclimation, nor of probiotic use in general.
[OPTIONAL ADD ON re gut-brain axis mention: For further context, though a relatively new field of study, there is research on the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the brain—known as the “gut-brain axis”—whereas the two are able to influence each other through biochemical signaling. This axis has most notably been connected to cognition and mood disorders.]
In fact, current research interestingly supports the idea that probiotics may actually play a beneficial role in mood—particularly in depression and anxiety. For example, one randomized controlled trial found a multi-strain probiotic led to improvements in mood, anxiety, and depression. That said, more extensive and rigorous clinical research is needed.
With this in mind, it is pertinent to note that mood changes may occur for a variety of reasons, relating to factors such as nutrition, sleep, stress, fluctuations in hormones, genetics and more. We would always advise an informed discussion with your physician if you feel any effects are adverse, as they may most appropriately advise with your unique medical history in mind.
sleep/energy


The scientific literature surrounding microbiome and sleep suggest that sleep loss and circadian misalignment in humans could be associated with dysbiosis, and that probiotic supplementation may be a potentially helpful therapy option. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study found that a probiotic containing Lactobacillus fermentum LF16, L. rhamnosus LR06, L. plantarum LP01, and Bifidobacterium longum BL04 contributed positively to mood state and improvement of sleep quality.


sleep/circadian rhythm
While a temporary acclimation period is normal to experience when first beginning a new probiotic, effects are generally confined to the gastrointestinal system and include things like mild changes to stool patterns, bloating or gas. This in mind, kindly note that [sleep disturbance / insomnia / disruption to circadian rhythm] is not an effect expected of acclimation, nor of probiotic use in general.
Just as the circadian rhythm (your sleep/wake cycle) can affect the microbiome, the microbiome, in return, appears to affect the circadian rhythm.​ The gut microbiome produces metabolites that influence signaling pathways in your gut that help coordinate digestive, immunological, and endocrine functions​.
Interestingly, the scientific literature surrounding microbiome and sleep suggest that sleep loss and circadian misalignment in humans could be associated with dysbiosis, and therefore, in some cases, probiotic supplementation may be a potentially helpful therapy option. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study found that a probiotic containing Lactobacillus fermentum LF16, L. rhamnosus LR06, L. plantarum LP01, and Bifidobacterium longum BL04 contributed positively to mood state and improvement of sleep quality.
However, as there are many potential causes to sleep disruptions and circadian rhythm alterations, we would recommend an informed discussion with your physician if you feel any effects are adverse, as they may most appropriately advise with your unique medical history in mind.
Fatigue
[OPTIONAL INTRO: To note, your body is an ecosystem, and the introduction of any new species into an ecosystem requires adaptation. As with any new diet, product, or change, you may experience a temporary acclimation period—this can be very normal.
However, acclimation effects are generally confined to the gastrointestinal tract, and thus fatigue is not an effect expected of acclimation nor of probiotic use in general.]
﻿
In general, current understanding of fatigue indicates it may result from a number of different lifestyle factors such as diet, physical activity levels, and sleep, as well as some medical conditions, among other elements. Currently there are no scientific studies which demonstrate probiotics as causative agents of fatigue.
Interestingly, based on available research, probiotics may actually have a positive impact on fatigue, particularly in post-infectious or chronic fatigue. For example, one clinical trial with post-infectious fatigue and another trial with fatigue associated with long COVID showed the group receiving probiotics reported a lower incidence of chronic fatigue. That said, additional research is certainly needed to properly understand the impact or relationship between probiotics strains on fatigue.
That said, while current research may not indicate a link, we certainly believe personal experiences are important. If you feel the fatigue you are experiencing may be adverse, it may be pertinent to discuss this with your physician to ensure an evaluation of contributing factors. 
Brain fog
While a temporary acclimation period is normal to experience when first beginning a new probiotic, any effects from this are generally confined to the gastrointestinal system and include things like mild changes to stool patterns, bloating, or gas. This in mind, kindly note that brain fog is not an effect expected of acclimation, nor of probiotic use in general.
[OPTIONAL ADD ON re gut-brain axis mention: For further context, though a relatively new field of study, there is research on the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the brain—known as the “gut-brain axis”—whereas the two are able to influence each other through biochemical signaling. This axis has most notably been connected to cognition and mood disorders.]
Interestingly, research suggests probiotics primarily exert beneficial effects regarding mood and cognition. For example, one systematic review concluded that probiotics have the potential to enhance cognitive function or attenuate cognitive decline, though additional research is warranted.
Ultimately, while research continues to explore the gut-brain axis, further clinical trials are needed to better understand the impacts of probiotics and the gut microbiome on cognitive function.
[OPTIONAL ADD ON re: SIBO / brain fog study, if applicable / referenced by member: To note, one widely criticized SIBO/“brain fog” study suggested that the probiotic organisms produced a metabolite called D-lactate, which, in elevated amounts, can manifest as brain fog in individuals with short bowel syndrome. However, this study is widely regarded as controversial: it is not a randomized, double-blinded study, and probiotics were not the only therapies being used during the study. In fact, other scientists published an article to dispute the claims made by the study.]
Headaches/migraines
Interestingly, there are emerging studies focusing on probiotic supplementation for migraine treatments. Some research suggests probiotics can reduce the severity + frequency of migraines in children​ and adults​. However, one trial ​found there were no significant differences with probiotic supplementation​.
Due to the variability in studies and the difference in the probiotic dose + strain used for each study, more rigorous trials are needed to confirm the effects on migraines.
That said, as there are many potential causes for headaches​ or migraines​, we would always advise an informed discussion with your physician as they may most appropriately advise with your unique medical history in mind. 
Longer:
There are many potential causes for headaches​ or migraines​.
Though a relatively new field of study, there is research on the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the brain—known as the “gut-brain axis”—whereas the two are able to influence each other through biochemical signaling. Although this axis is most notably connected to cognition and mood disorders, the gut-brain axis has been studied in the context of migraines​—specifically on how gut dysbiosis and inflammation may be associated with migraines, albeit the exact mechanisms are still not well-understood.
Interestingly, there are studies that show migraines may be associated with some gastrointestinal (GI) conditions such as irritable bowel disease​ (IBS) or inflammatory bowel disease(IBD​). It is hypothesized the dysbiosis in these GI conditions may contribute to migraines—for example, one study found individuals with migraines had an altered microbiota​ compared to the controls.
With this in mind, there are emerging studies focusing on probiotic supplementation for migraine treatments. Some research suggests probiotics can reduce the severity + frequency of migraines in children​ and adults​. However, in contrast, another trial ​found there were no significant differences with probiotic supplementation​.
Due to the variability in studies and the difference in the probiotic dose + strain used for each study, more rigorous trials are needed to confirm the effects on migraines.
﻿Cerebral Palsy
Kindly note, [PDS-08® Pediatric Daily Synbiotic / DS-01® Daily Synbiotic] has not been studied in individuals living with cerebral palsy, so we are unable to comment on any difference in effect or utility in this population [or whether an alternate dosage would be appropriate].
Ultimately, we always defer to the individual’s doctor when considering whether or not to add [PDS-08®/DS-01®] to their routine.
This in mind, I’d be happy to share with you some of the current research surrounding cerebral palsy, the gut microbiome, and probiotics, if it would be helpful for you.
Insert 1 or more of relevant research topics below
[Optional technical/practitioner closing: For a more detailed narrative review of the studies to date on cerebral palsy, the gut microbiome, and pre/pro/synbiotics, I also recommend Probiotics, Prebiotics, and Synbiotics on Constipation in Children with Cerebral Palsy.]
Cerebral palsy and constipation
﻿25-74% of individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) experience constipation, and it is one of the leading causes of hospitalization in children with CP. Many CP-related factors can contribute to this constipation, including but not limited to difficulty swallowing, low or excessive muscle tone, differences in neurological control of the gastrointestinal tract, use of anticonvulsants, and reduced mobility. 
Cerebral palsy and gut microbiome
Given the emerging research on the gut-brain-microbiome axis and how gut dysbiosis may contribute to or be associated with various neurological disorders, it has also been hypothesized that dysbiosis may be associated with CP and CP-associated constipation as well.
Of note, one study in children with cerebral palsy and epilepsy (CPE––epilepsy is a frequent comorbidity with CP) found that those with CPE had a more diverse gut microbiome than healthy children. The microbiome composition and abundance of certain taxa also significantly differed between children with and without CPE, as did the microbial pathways available for the degradation or production of certain metabolites.
However, although CP gut microbiomes differ from those of healthy children across multiple studies, the exact differences in community structure vary with different study populations and methodologies.
cerebral palsy and probiotics
Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics have also been proposed as a means of alleviating some of the symptoms associated with CP––in particular, constipation. Two studies in rat models of CP found that CP itself had more of an effect on the gut microbiome than probiotics did. Although probiotics slowed the inflammatory response over time and improved measures of neuromotor and digestive health, improvements in mood and cognition were inconsistent between the two studies.
Only two rigorous studies of probiotics and prebiotics have been conducted in children with CP to date. In one study, a combination of a multi-strain probiotic and fiber improved multiple markers of constipation and increased gut microbiome diversity in children with CP, regardless of whether the children received a liquid or “standard” diet. To tease apart the impacts of probiotics vs. prebiotics, another study gave children with CP a probiotic (Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938), a prebiotic (agave inulin), probiotic+prebiotic, or a placebo. Interestingly, probiotics decreased the stool pH and increased the frequency of spontaneous bowel movements, while the prebiotics decreased the frequency of hard stools and increased the frequency of hard stools; however, these effects were not seen in the synbiotic.
Although these initial findings are promising, it should also be noted that every study thus far has used different probiotics and different prebiotics, and that most sample sizes are fairly small. Many more rigorous clinical studies are therefore needed to determine whether probiotics, prebiotics, or both could be an effective intervention for CP-associated symptoms––and if so, which strains and dosages would be best, and for which symptoms.
Down syndrome
It’s important to note that DS-01® Daily Synbiotic is regulated by the FDA as a dietary supplement, and as such, is not intended to treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition. Additionally, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied in individuals living with Down Syndrome specifically; therefore, we are unable to comment on any difference in effect or utility within this population.
[OPTIONAL ADD-ON: For context, DS-01® is formulated to provide support for digestive and systemic health with core benefits across gastrointestinal function, gut barrier integrity, immune health, cardiovascular health, micronutrient synthesis, and dermatological health. DS-01® is not considered or regulated as a therapeutic and is therefore not intended to treat or prevent any condition or disease state. ]
This in mind, I'd be happy to share with you the current research perspective on Down Syndrome, the gut microbiome, and probiotics. [Insert topics below]
[OPTIONAL ADD-ON: While DS-01® is generally safe and tolerable, it is important to note that when starting any new health regimen, some GI distress, is a normal part of the acclimation period. Acclimation length varies per individual, but generally lasts a few weeks.
In those with an already sensitive constitution, the introduction of a potent synbiotic may lead to more pronounced GI symptoms when acclimating. Thus, we advise individuals with pre-existing digestive conditions exercise extra caution when adding a new product to their routine and consult with their primary care provider who may provide guidance with your personal health history in mind. ]
To conclude, the pathophysiology of developmental disorders like Down Syndrome are quite complex in nature, and further research is required to determine more definitive therapeutic recommendations for management. Importantly, we highly encourage consultation with [your/your family member's] healthcare practitioner(s) who may advise on specific recommendations with [your/their] complete health history in mind.
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
Although a relatively new field of study, there is research on the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the brain—known as the “gut-brain axis”—whereby the two can influence each other through biochemical signaling. This axis has most notably been connected to cognition and mood disorders.
Interestingly, research​ suggests disruptions to the gut microbiome (i.e. dysbiosis) may play a role in the pathogenesis of OCD, possibly through the gut-brain axis. For this reason, there are emerging studies examining the potential therapeutic value of probiotics on OCD.
In addition, one study​ using an in vitro mouse model found probiotic strain, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, led to reduction of OCD-like behavior comparable to fluoxentine (a common medication prescribed for OCD). Another in vitro study​ found similar results with a different strain, Lactobacillus casei Shirota, where probiotic treatment modulated genetic markers of OCD, possibly through serotonin-related genes.
However, a caveat with in vitro testing is that, despite the ability to produce efficient preliminary results, these studies often fail to replicate the conditions of a human body. Unfortunately, there is a lack of clinical trials in humans to assess the effect of probiotics on OCD symptoms. Therefore, though the link between the gut microbiome and OCD​ have been found in multiple in vitro studies, trials in humans are required to assess if probiotics can be an adequate treatment for OCD.
ADHD
You may have heard of the term "gut-brain-axis", which describes the bidirectional relationship which exists between the gut microbiome and the central nervous system (CNS), and the pathway thought to be responsible for the link between peripheral intestinal disorders (for example, IBS) and cognitive dysfunction (for example, migraines).
Further exploring the relationship between cognitive functionality and our microbiomes, the gut microbiome has been noted as a potential player in the development of several neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopment disorders, such as ADHD. Current findings in this research area point to bacteria composition, gastrointestinal symptoms, and immune dysregulation related to microbiome alterations may all be implicated in such conditions.
While exciting and fast-growing, its important to acknowledge that the majority of research the gut-brain-axis as it pertains to ADHD is associative, and how this translates to the application of probiotics is not yet known. You may be interested in this literature review that summarizes the current evidence on the role of the gut microbiome in ADHD pathophysiology and its therapeutic implications.
Dementia
It has been suggested that some probiotic strains have the ability to modulate mood and cognition through a rich and complex network of physiological pathways termed the 'gut-brain axis'.
The mechanisms of communication between the gastrointestinal tract and the nervous system has generated interest in the link between the microbiome and cognitive decline. It is thought that gut microorganisms may play a role in memory consolidation, neurotransmitter production, receptor signaling, and oxidative stress, to name a few.
That said, it’s important to acknowledge that this is a very new field of study. While the literature on the possible mechanisms involved in gut microbiota modulation and the pathophysiology of dementia is expanding, the research regarding the use of probiotics and synbiotics to improve cognitive function is still in its infancy—and at this time there is insufficient evidence to support their clinical application for dementia.
Levodopa / Carbidopa (Parkinson Disease Medication)
Version 1 (summary / most simple)
There are not any known contraindications between probiotics and over the counter or prescription medications, such as levodopa/carbidopa. With this in mind, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic would be generally safe to take alongside levodopa/carbidopa, or any other prescription or over-the-counter medications.
[OPTIONAL ADD ON In case you're aware of this research: while it has been documented​ that the Enterococcus genus, found in some probiotic supplements, may inactivate levodopa, DS-01® does not include strains from this genus. Further, although several Lactobacillus species were found to harbor the gene for the inactivating enzyme, DS-01® does not contain these specific strains. (if needed, include information from General Strain Specificity Education) ]
Ultimately, we always recommend consulting with a prescribing physician regarding the combined utility of DS-01® and any medications in your routine, so they may advise with the complete knowledge of your health history and the specific medication.
Version 2 (deeper explanation)
There are not any known contraindications between probiotics and over the counter or prescription medications, such as levodopa/carbidopa. With this in mind, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic would be generally safe to take alongside levodopa/carbidopa, or any other prescription or over-the-counter medications.
For some background, levodopa (L-DOPA) needs to remain its precursor form to be able to cross the blood-brain barrier. L-DOPA is then converted to dopamine in neurons by an enzyme called aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). Therefore, levodopa is generally paired with an AADC inhibitor, like carbidopa, to prevent premature conversion outside the central nervous system.
While it has been documented​ that the Enterococcus genus, found in some probiotic supplements, may inactivate L-DOPA by converting it to dopamine through a bacterial enzyme, tyrosine decarboxylase (TDC)—DS-01® does not include strains from this genus. Interestingly, the carbidopa inclusion made no difference, meaning it could not inhibit the TDC conversion. Although several Lactobacillus species were found to harbor the gene for the inactivating enzyme, DS-01® does not contain these specific strains. (if needed, include information from General Strain Specificity Education)
In addition, a study found Bifidobacterium, a commensal and common probiotic genus, was able to convert L-DOPA to a different end-product (DHPLA)—which is an unusable, irreversible end product that limits the bioavailability of L-DOPA. However, Bifidobacterium uses a different pathway than TDC (from above), and is a much less efficient process (1-12% in in vitro conditions) and may not present a significant barrier to levodopa/carbidopa metabolism like TDC.
Ultimately, we always recommend consulting with a prescribing physician regarding the combined utility of DS-01® and any medications in your routine, so they may advise with the complete knowledge of your health history and the specific medication.




26. Gastritis / H pylori
﻿Research has indicated that probiotics may help in improving Helicobacter pylori infection and its associated symptoms by strengthening immune status and decreasing gut permeability. You may also be interested in this study, which looked at the positive effects of 2 strains in reducing stomach inflammation due to H. pylori infection. Kindly note that this study was done in mice, not humans. Further, a review synthesized data demonstrating that probiotic strains, in combination with traditional antibiotic therapy, helped to decrease gastrointestinal symptoms of individuals with H. pylori, as well as reducing the side effects of antibiotics.
Of note, the evidence for probiotics in the management of H. pylori is certainly in its infancy. We would recommend consulting with a primary care provider in regards to therapeutics for H. Pylori as they are best suited to advise under the complete knowledge of your personal health history.

[if asking about gastritis: As one of the main causes of chronic gastritis include Helicobacter pylori, mitigating H. pylori infection could help with reducing incidence of gastritis. One study showed probiotic bacteria were able to stimulate a pathway to lead to anti-inflammatory signals.
﻿Research has indicated that probiotics may help in improving H. pylori infection and its associated symptoms by strengthening immune status and decreasing gut permeability. You may also be interested in this study, which looked at the positive effects of 2 strains in reducing stomach inflammation due to H. pylori infection. ]
[OPTIONAL if non-H. pylori gastritis: However, as this field is currently focused on H. pylori-related gastritis, further research and clinical trials are needed to better understand probiotics + gastritis in a non-H. pylori context. ]
Biofilm
DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied in the context of biofilms or intestinal yeast/bacteria overgrowth specifically; therefore, we cannot comment on any effects in this regard. However, I'd be happy to share some information from scientific literature!
One potential mechanism that could aid in the reduction of bacterial overgrowth is the use of antibiotics or biocides for their antibacterial activity—however, with the rise of bacterial resistance to antibiotics and biocides, this option may be a greater challenge in the future. Similarly, antimicrobial peptides (naturally occurring small proteins) can also be antimicrobial and potentially have anti-biofilm activity. A review​ points out that while promising, the difficulties in synthetically creating these peptides and the lack of efficacy in clinical trials has hindered the use of these peptides. Further, these peptides are not intended to replace​ the use of an antibiotic, but perhaps used in conjunction to boost the efficacy.
Further, this review​ examines probiotic use in potentially affecting biofilms; however, the mechanisms of probiotics to achieve these effects are not yet well understood. Interestingly, probiotics can create their own biofilm​, preventing the "bad bacteria" from making their biofilm.
Of note, biofilm formation may be a 'symptom' of an underlying disease​ or condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease or gastritis; therefore, it may be pertinent to consult your primary care physician as they can best advise knowing your full health history.
27. C. Difficile Infection (CDI)


[If pertinent to product:
It’s important to note that DS-01® Daily Synbiotic is regulated by the FDA as a dietary supplement, and as such, is not intended to treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition. Additionally, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied in individuals living with C. difficile infection (CDI) specifically; therefore, we are unable to comment on any difference in effect or utility within this population.
That said, I'd be happy to share some information on the research landscape of probiotics and CDI, if that is of use. ]
Many studies​ have examined how probiotics might be used to prevent the development of CDI in those who are most vulnerable to it (typically, individuals​ who are hospitalized and receiving multiple antibiotics), or minimize some associated symptoms. [OPTIONAL Example: For example, a large observational study was also conducted over ten years, which found that the strains Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285, Lactobacillus casei LBC80R, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus CLR2 may be helpful in decreasing the overall rate of C. difficile infection.]
That said, some of these studies have been promising, results​ have overall been mixed, leading to a lack of consensus about which strains (or combinations) are most effective at preventing CDI. In addition, most studies focus on prevention, rather than how probiotics might be used alongside or after antibiotic therapy for CDI.
All in all, much more human clinical research is needed to determine the optimal use of probiotics in the prevention, treatment, and recovery of CDI. 


28. SIBO / IMO (Intestinal Methanogen Overgrowth)


Version 1 (summary / most simple)
To begin, do note DS-01® has not been studied in individuals living with a diagnosis of SIBO, and the decontamination of bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine was not an endpoint we targeted in forming our product. Further, DS-01® is not intended to treat, prevent or cure any condition or disease state, such as SIBO. Therefore, I am unable to comment on any differences in effect or utility in this regard.
For some background, as the research on SIBO advances, primary care physicians continue to develop their understanding of the diagnosis and management of the condition. Current treatment usually consists of oral antibiotics. However, since many broad-spectrum antibiotics have considerable side-effect profiles, alternative therapies are being explored—including the use of probiotics, which may be effective in reducing the bacterial burden in individuals with SIBO, and alleviating their symptoms.
That said, at this time, there is no blanket recommendation on which probiotic strains are best for SIBO management. It is often trial and error to determine which strains will be beneficial for each patient/individual, as individual responses to probiotics can and do vary (as with any supplement).
With this known, we ultimately recommend your decision to continue/begin use of DS-01® be made in conjunction with your primary care physician, as they have the most knowledge of your personal health history and unique manifestation of SIBO.
INTESTINAL METHANOGEN OVERGROWTH (a subtype of SIBO, with different diagnostics, characteristics, and probiotic studies)
﻿
Version 2 (deeper explanation)
To begin, do note DS-01® has not been studied in individuals living with a diagnosis of SIBO, and the decontamination of bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine was not an endpoint we targeted in forming our product. Further, DS-01® is not intended is not intended to treat, prevent or cure any condition or disease state, such as SIBO. Therefore, I am unable to comment on any differences in effect or utility in this regard.
For some background, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) develops when normal homeostatic mechanisms (i.e. gastric acids, normal GI motility and structure, and immune function) that control enteric bacterial populations are disrupted. As the name suggests, it’s what occurs when the small intestine becomes overgrown with bacteria.
In addition to the absolute number of organisms, the type of microbial flora that overgrow in the small intestine plays an important role in the manifestation of signs and symptoms of overgrowth, and often leads to differential treatments.
Some of the symptoms of SIBO include, but are not limited to, post-meal bloating; increased, malodorous flatulence; changes to stool (looser in hydrogen-dominant SIBO; constipation in methane-dominant SIBO); and nutrient absorption issues (which can result in weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, and macronutrient malabsorption). While less studied, some individuals report neurocognitive effects like brain fog, confusion, anxiety and depression; as well as allergic and topical presentations (i.e., rosacea, eczema, and food intolerances).
As the research on SIBO advances, primary care physicians continue to develop their understanding of the diagnosis and management of the condition.
﻿
[OPTIONAL INFO on diagnostic testing: The most common diagnostic method due to its low cost and limited invasiveness is measuring products of fermentation with breath testing. However, this testing method has limited sensitivity and specificity, and does not identify all fermentation byproducts (for example, hydrogen sulfide, in most breath tests).
Historically, gastroenterologists have chosen to aspirate the jejunum for bacteria; however, this comes with its own unique challenges, particularly that the sample taken may not represent the overgrowth present, and there is a high risk of contamination during and after the sampling.]
Current treatment usually consists of oral antibiotics, and dose will vary depending on the form of SIBO an individual presents with. Uniquely, SIBO patients are often prescribed antibiotics that selectively operate in the GI tract (i.e., rifaximin) and do not get absorbed by the body. As a consequence, they are less likely to cause systemic issues associated with antibiotic use.
However, since any antibiotic may still come with associated risks, and some individuals may be reluctant to use antibiotics, alternative therapies are being explored, including the use of probiotics. The aforementioned meta-analysis, which summarized 18 clinical trials, suggested that probiotics may be an effective management strategy for SIBO by reducing bacterial overgrowths, decreasing hydrogen concentrations, and mitigating common symptoms, including abdominal pain.
High-quality trials of probiotics in SIBO are still somewhat limited, so strain- and dosage-specific protocols have yet to be defined.
For example, one study on the spore-forming microorganism Bacillus clausii produced a rate of normalization of hydrogen breath tests that was comparable to antibiotics. In another study, Lactobacillus casei and L. acidophilus strains proved effective in treating chronic diarrhea related to bacterial overgrowth, while another showed efficacy in patients with SIBO and functional intestinal distention. However, it is challenging to compare results or glean a general consensus from these studies given their differences in study populations, probiotic species, clinical outcomes, number of study participants, and shortcomings in study design.
Other treatment options may include dietary changes, herbal antimicrobials, and even fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT).
Ultimately, because each SIBO patient has a unique ecosystem, there is no blanket recommendation on which probiotic strains are best for SIBO management. As with any supplement, individual responses to probiotics can and do vary, so it it is often trial and error to determine which strains will be beneficial for each patient/individual.
With all of this information known, we ultimately recommend your decision to begin/continue use of DS-01® be made in conjunction with your primary care physician, as they have the most knowledge of your personal health history and unique manifestation of SIBO.
﻿
Version 3 (deepest + most scientific)
To begin, do note DS-01® has not been studied in individuals living with a diagnosis of SIBO, and the decontamination of bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine was not an endpoint we targeted in forming our product. Further, DS-01® is not intended is not intended to treat, prevent or cure any condition or disease state, such as SIBO. Therefore, I am unable to comment on any differences in effect or utility in this regard.
For some background, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) develops when normal homeostatic mechanisms (i.e. gastric acids, normal GI motility and structure, and immune function) that control enteric bacterial populations are disrupted. As the name suggests, it’s what occurs when the small intestine becomes overgrown with bacteria. SIBO falls under a broader umbrella term of digestive tract dysbiosis, which simply means an imbalance of bacteria, fungus, and other organisms in the digestive system. Dysbiosis can also occur in the large intestine—however, SIBO is unique in that under normal circumstances, the small intestine should have a relatively low concentration of bacteria. For context, the upper small intestine would typically have less than 103 organisms/mL of microorganisms, but in SIBO, these populations can often exceed 105–106.
In addition to the absolute number of organisms, the type of microbial flora that overgrow in the small intestine plays an important role in the manifestation of signs and symptoms of overgrowth, and often leads to differential treatments.
Some of these symptoms include, but are not limited to, postprandial bloating; increased, malodorous flatulence; changes to stool (looser in hydrogen-dominant SIBO; constipation in methane-dominant SIBO); nutrient absorption issues (which can result in weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, and macronutrient malabsorption). While less studied, some individuals report neurocognitive effects like brain fog, confusion, anxiety and depression and allergic and topical presentations (i.e., rosacea, eczema, and food intolerances).
As the research on SIBO advances, primary care physicians continue to develop their understanding of the diagnosis and management of the condition.
Technically, SIBO is not a condition itself—but rather, a lab finding, based on a glucose or lactulose breath test. The most common diagnostic method, due to its low cost and limited invasiveness, is measuring products of fermentation with breath testing, though it has limited sensitivity and specificity and does not identify all fermentation byproducts (i.e., hydrogen sulfide).
Aspirating the jejunum for bacteria has been historically performed; however, this comes with its own unique challenges, particularly that the sample taken may not represent the overgrowth present, and there is a high risk of contamination during and after the sampling.
Current treatment usually consists of oral antibiotics: types, as well as dose, will vary, depending on the form of SIBO an individual presents with. Uniquely, SIBO patients are often prescribed antibiotics that selectively operate in the GI tract (i.e., rifaximin) and do not get absorbed by the body. As a consequence, they are less likely to cause systemic issues associated with antibiotic use.

With all of this information known, we ultimately recommend your decision to continue use of DS-01® be made in conjunction with your primary care physician, as they have the most knowledge of your personal health history and unique manifestation of SIBO.
﻿
[OPTIONAL ADD IN: SIBO / IBS connection: An interesting point to note that, in theory, individuals can test positive for SIBO but not present with any typical symptoms. So, unlike IBS—which is also not considered a condition but instead a set of digestive symptoms which may include bloating, GI discomfort, and changes to stool—SIBO has a formalized test associated with it, whereas IBS does not (making it somewhat more concrete to diagnose).
Patients who test positive for SIBO may have IBS symptoms, but the reverse is not always true. However, it has been observed that more than one-third of IBS patients test positive for SIBO. ]
﻿
[OPTIONAL ADD IN: CONCERNS ABOUT PRECISION RELEASE:
DS-01® has not been studied in individuals living with a diagnosis of SIBO, and the decontamination of bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine was not an endpoint we targeted in forming our product. Further, DS-01® is not intended to treat, prevent or cure any condition or disease state, such as SIBO. Therefore, I am unable to comment on any differences in effect or utility in this regard.
Having said that, we have specially designed our registered 2-in-1 capsule delivery technology, ViaCap®—which is a proprietary capsule-in-capsule system we developed to safeguard the viability of the probiotic organisms in DS-01® through digestion—for complete, precision release delivery to the colon.
In this 2-in-1 design, the inner capsule (which houses our probiotic formula) is nested within an outer capsule containing the free floating prebiotic powder. This separation of the probiotics from the prebiotics helps ensure shelf stability, and bacterial viability. Further, this outer capsule acts as a barrier to oxygen, moisture, and heat—avoiding the need for refrigeration of DS-01®.
To understand how this delivery technology performs, we've tested this system in the Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME®)--the closest system developed to model digestion and the gut. It is intended to recreate the physiological conditions and biological processes representative of a healthy human gastrointestinal tract. Based on the results of this in vitro testing, the probiotic dose is fully released at the end of the small intestine for complete delivery to the colon.
As probiotics are most effective when they make it to your colon alive, this nested capsule technology is a vital aspect of DS-01®. However, we've not not tested our product specifically within the context of SIBO, as mentioned—so we are unable to comment on any potential differences in potency or efficacy profiles of the ViaCap® delivery technology. What I can offer is that the green acid-resistant vegan outer capsule is made of hypromellose, water, and chlorophyllin, all ingredients which are not known to be fermented by large or small intestinal bacteria. ]
DS + Low-FODMAP
DS-01® Daily Synbiotic is low-FODMAP compliant, and we would not expect the emergence of any adverse effects in those with an intolerance to fructans.
For some context, our Microbiota-Accessible Polyphenolic Precursor [MAPP] introduces plant-based, non-fermenting prebiotic compounds isolated and purified from the fruit and skin of Indian pomegranates. These compounds are called punicalagins—a powerful group of polyphenols that gut bacteria can biotransform into beneficial metabolites for the body.
Punicalagins are unique compared to other traditional prebiotic compounds, like dietary fibers (i.e., fructooligosaccharides (FOS), galactooligosaccharides (GOS), or inulin). This is because fermenting fibers typically “feed” microbes and encourage growth, which may sometimes cause discomfort for individuals with FODMAP intolerance. Conversely, non-fermenting punicalagins neither inhibit nor support the growth of resident microbes, but instead extend their benefits by producing metabolites.
Still, in those with an already sensitive constitution, introducing a potent synbiotic like DS-01® may lead to more pronounced (yet temporary) gastrointestinal symptoms as the body adjusts to a newcomer—similar to any new diet, product, or change. As such, we suggest that individuals with pre-existing digestive conditions exercise caution when adding a new product to their routine and consult with their primary care provider, who can advise on intake with their complete health history in mind.
29. Food intolerance


What kind of allergen testing does Seed conduct? Is [DS-01® / PDS-08®] free from [x] allergen?


Seed conducts comprehensive allergen testing on all of our products. Our allergen panel includes over 20 of the most common allergens, including all 14 classes of allergens as defined by the European Food and Safety Authority (EFSA). This panel extends well beyond the minimum 8 allergens required to test by the FDA.
However, it’s important to note that the FDA has established no clear guidelines for what it means to be “free” of allergens.
Therefore, for maximal transparency and integrity, Seed conducts this testing on all of our products and ensures any substance present in our products is at a level below an established reference dose––the Eliciting Dose, or ED-01, which is grounded in clinical evidence and is considered the most precise method for assessing allergenicity. The ED-01 is the eliciting dose required to produce an objective [allergic] response in 1% of the allergic population.
All allergens we test for are below the ED-01, so our probiotics are therefore considered to be safe for those with allergies to the tested-for allergens.
The following allergens are tested for in all of our consumer products—
* Almond Allergen
* Brazil Nut Allergen
* Cashew Allergen
* Celery Allergen
* Corn Allergen
* Gluten Allergen [across barley, rye, oats + wheat] (wheat protein)
* Crustacean Allergen
* Egg Allergen
* Fish Allergen
* Hazelnut Allergen
* Lupin Allergen
* Macadamia Nut Allergen
* Milk Allergen
* Molluscs Allergen
* Mustard Allergen
* Peanut Allergen
* Pecan Allergen
* Pistachio Allergen
* Sesame Allergen
* Soy Allergen
* Sulfite Dioxide
* Walnut Allergen
That said, we always encourage folks who are concerned about allergies or sensitivities to consult with a primary care provider.
[ ADD-ON for gluten: [DS-01® / PDS-08® Pediatric] Daily Synbiotic is safe for gluten-free diets, as we are below the established threshold of 20ppm. ]
If asking about '20mg gluten per 1 kg': You'll note this is in the units parts per million (ppm) which is equivalent to 20 milligram (mg) per kilogram (kg). ]
[OPTIONAL ADD-ON for nut allergy questions, specifically: DS-01® Daily Synbiotic was not formulated with any nuts or nut-derived ingredients. You may view our entire label with included ingredients ﻿here.]
[OPTIONAL ADD-ON: …[DS-01®/PDS-08®] products are free of binders, preservatives, synthetic flow agents, AMPA, glyphosate, GMOs, sulfites, and sugar.]
[OPTIONAL ADD-ON extended version with information on our testing: The FDA has established no clear guidelines for what it means to be “free” of allergens including peanuts, tree nuts, milk, soy, wheat, etc. So, in theory, a company’s claim of “Nut Free” could simply mean the product does not contain nuts as an ingredient even though it is manufactured on the same equipment that processes nuts. Most manufactured foods and dietary supplements contain trace amounts of allergens, but third party testing helps ensure that those allergens are present well below a limit at which an allergic response is elicited.] AND/OR [Optional add-on: If you are interested, you can always read more about our testing practices under the ‘Testing’ section here.]

30. Allergies, immune system, inflammation


Rash/skin/allergy
To note, your body is an ecosystem, and the introduction of any new species into an ecosystem requires adaptation. As with any new diet, product, or change, you may experience a temporary acclimation period—this can be very normal.
However, these acclimation effects are generally confined to the gastrointestinal tract, so kindly note that skin disruptions are not an effect we would expect from probiotic use in general. While it is theorized that disruptions in the first several months of new probiotic use is a result of a correcting microbiota in flux, there have not been any longitudinal studies (i.e. studies of the same subject over a period of time) to our knowledge to test this hypothesis.
That said, the gut microbiome may play a role in a wide variety of skin conditions, by way of the gut-skin axis—the bidirectional relationship between your gut microbes and your skin. In fact, several of the strains included in our [DS-01® / PDS-08®] have been studied for their beneficial effects on skin, including support of healthy, clear-looking skin–you can view more about our [DS-01® strain research / PDS-08® strain research] on our website.

﻿
[OPTIONAL ADD ON: depending on the details provided, it may be appropriate to provide information on our allergen testing / ingredients if member mentions an allergic-type reaction. See Allergen Testing Card]
[OPTIONAL ADD ON: wash out period recommendation from Acclimation Remedies/Suggestions—DS-01®]
Ultimately, if you ever feel any effects you’ve experienced may be adverse, we would encourage a discussion with your primary care physician or dermatologist who may most appropriately advise with your unique health history in mind.
﻿Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS)
DS-01® has not been studied in those diagnosed with mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), so we cannot comment on any differences in effect within this population.
That said, regarding the research on probiotics as a whole, you may find a recent review​ interesting, which discussed the effect of many probiotic preparations and found that probiotics may have a beneficial impact on mast cell signaling and could potentially be effective at alleviating symptoms in individuals with MCAS.
You may also be interested in a study which demonstrated that the probiotic strains Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG, L. rhamnosus LC705, Propionibacterium freudenreichii JS, and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 may potentially support the downregulation of IgE and histamine receptor genes, thereby potentially diminishing mast cell allergy-related activation.
[OPTIONAL ADD ON if asking about any negative effects from taking DS-01® w/ this disease: Though we have not studied DS-01® in individuals with MCAS, we have conducted in vitro testing​ on our product, which demonstrated that DS-01® strains do not raise histamine under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions.
That said, as a company rooted in science, we often inform our members of the potential inability of in vitro results to replicate in real-world conditions, though producing efficient preliminary results.
With all of the above in mind, everyone has a unique physiology, and the responses to probiotics can and do vary. As such, it may be pertinent to consult with your personal physician, who can advise on your probiotic intake with complete knowledge of your health history in mind.]
Celiac
The current clinical guidelines​ for the treatment of Celiac Disease (CD) involve omitting gluten and gluten-containing products from the diet. While it is known gluten is the trigger in CD, evidence has also indicated that intestinal microbiota​ may be involved in the pathogenesis, progression, and clinical presentation of CD.
Several studies have reported imbalances in the intestinal microbiota of patients with CD. These observations are mainly characterized by an increased abundance of Bacteroides species and a decrease in Bifidobacterium species. In conjunction with a gluten-free diet treatment protocol, certain probiotics (namely, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus) have been reported to restore gut microbiota composition and enable the pre-digestion of gluten in the intestinal lumen—ultimately reducing the inflammation associated with gluten intake, intestinal permeability, and cytokine + antibody production.
In a pilot study that observed the effects of s probiotic-containing food supplement on the gut microbial balance in celiac children on a gluten-free diet, recipients of the supplement saw intestinal microbial composition alteration to more closely match that of healthy individuals, notably, with a decrease in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio.
That said, a meta-analysis​ found that while probiotics may play a role in CD treatment, current clinical trial data is insufficient to make this conclusion. Therefore, further research and human clinical trials with larger subject sizes are needed to assess probiotics as a potential CD therapy.
NSAIDs
There are no known contraindications between probiotics and medications; therefore, [DS-01®️ / PDS-08®️ Pediatric] Daily Synbiotic would be generally safe to take alongside any NSAIDs, [including ibuprofen] or any prescription or over-the-counter medication(s).
For context, the effect of NSAID medications on the gut microbiome is just beginning to be studied, but at this time, research has not yet established if the medications are causing changes in the gut microbiome or if the underlying condition that the NSAIDs are treating are causing any changes.
Interestingly, during and after NSAID use may be a good time for probiotics. This review explores how probiotics could be a useful tool to help modulate the composition of the intestinal microbiota, as a new therapeutic strategy for NSAID-induced small intestinal damage.
Ultimately, we always recommend consulting with a prescribing physician regarding the combined utility of [DS-01®️ / PDS-08®️] and any medications in your routine, so they may advise with the complete knowledge of your health history and the specific medication.
﻿(longer)
There are no known contraindications between probiotics and medications; therefore, [DS-01®️ / PDS-08®️ Pediatric] Daily Synbiotic would be generally safe to take alongside any NSAIDs, [including ibuprofen] or any prescription or over-the-counter medication(s).
NSAID-induced dysbiosis is well documented, however, aside from identification of the microbial signature changes associated with these medications, much less is known about the underlying mechanisms, as few studies have directly addressed the hypothesized potential contributors. Namely, mucosal inflammation, changes in intestinal motility, luminal pH and bile acid metabolism, or direct drug-induced inhibitory effect on bacterial growth.
In short, the research has not established if the medications are causing changes in the gut microbiome, or if the underlying condition that the NSAIDs are treating, results in said changes.
Despite this, research suggests that during and after NSAID use may be a good time for probiotics. For example, this review explores how probiotics could be a useful tool to help modulate the composition of the intestinal microbiota, as a new therapeutic strategy for NSAID-induced small intestinal damage.
Ultimately, we always recommend consulting with a prescribing physician regarding the combined utility of [DS-01®️ / PDS-08®️] and any medications in your routine, so they may advise with the complete knowledge of your health history and the specific medication.
﻿immunosuppressants/immunocompromised:
Although there are no known contraindications between probiotics and medications, kindly note that DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied in immunocompromised individuals, so we are unable to comment on any difference in effect or utility within this population.
It is also important to be aware that isolated cases of immunocompromised individuals developing systemic infections as a result of probiotic use have occurred, leading to unclear guidance​ as to whether or not probiotics are safe for those who are immunocompromised (whether intrinsically or due to medical treatment, such as immunosuppressants).
With all of this in mind, we encourage you to consult with your physician before adding DS-01® to your routine, as they can offer advice based on your unique medical history and medication regimen.


31. Urinary / urogenital


Hyperoxaluria / Oxalate Metabolism / Oxalate Content


[OPTIONAL ADD ON for contextual information about the condition of Hyperoxaluria:
For context, hyperoxaluria is a condition that can occur with a high urine oxalate concentration. Although oxalate is a natural chemical made by the body, and is found in some foods, too much oxalate can cause issues, such as kidney stones. While primary hyperoxaluria is inherited, secondary hyperoxaluria can be caused by other factors, such as a high oxalate diet, or intestinal problems that cause the body to absorb more oxalate from foods.
Ultimately, the goal of treatment for hyperoxaluria is generally to lower oxalate levels in the body and prevent calcium oxalate crystals from forming. This is often done through prescription medications, dietary supplements, dietary changes, and in some cases, procedures. ]
First, it's important to note that we have not studied [DS-01® / PDS-08®] Daily Synbiotic for any effects on oxalate metabolism specifically, nor in people with [primary/secondary Hyperoxaluria]. With this in mind, we're ultimately unable to comment on any differences in effect, safety, or utility in this regard.
That said, in case it's helpful, I'd be happy to provide some information based on a current review of the literature, in regard to probiotics and oxalate metabolism in general.
In scientific literature, lactic acid bacteria​ (including Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus) have been found to have some oxalate degradation properties—however, the species and strain are important as these oxalate-degrading mechanisms are specific to each strain. Of note, Oxalobacter formigenes, the "best" studied oxalate-degrading gut bacteria, uses oxalate as its primary energy source; although results in animals studies​ have been encouraging, human clinical trials​​ with this probiotic species have not been successful at reducing oxalate (in urinary excretion).
Interestingly, one study​ in mice found short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were associated with decreased levels of urinary oxalates. However, it is important to note this study was conducted in mice and may not be translatable to humans. Therefore, further studies are needed to understand the supplementation of probiotics or other bacterial metabolites on oxalate reduction.
Overall, further studies are needed to better understand the supplementation of probiotics or other bacterial metabolites and how that may impact oxalate reduction or metabolism. We would ultimately recommend consulting with a healthcare provider in regards to appropriate supplements, as they are best suited to advise with your complete health history in mind.
[OPTIONAL ADD ON if asking about more information on Oxalobacter formigenes probiotic strain]
In reviewing this paper​, it appears that it may be difficult to make probiotics containing O. formigenes, potentially "due to its sensitivity to oxygen and low pH, strict oxalate demand for growth, and intolerance to the processes which are commonly involved in the manufacture, storage, and distribution of probiotic products." Given this, and additional studies this paper references, it appears that more research is needed to determine the production conditions necessary for the commercial development of consistent and reliable O. formigenes probiotic supplements.
﻿
[OPTIONAL ADD ON if asking about Oxalate content in DS-01®—particularly as it relates to pomegranate punicalagins)
To start, it’s important to note that we have not directly measured oxalate amounts in DS-01® Daily Synbiotic.
That said, I’d be happy to provide you with additional information about DS-01®'s prebiotic ingredient, pomegranate punicalagins, as well as general research on pomegranates and kidney stones.
For context, the patented prebiotic formula in DS-01® (also called Microbiota-Accessible Polyphenolic Precursors™, MAPP) is a class of bioactive plant compounds (punicalagins) that are derived from the fruit and skin of Indian pomegranate. This prebiotic is a novel class of non-fermenting prebiotics, and the punicalagins exert their prebiotic effect when acted upon by specific microorganisms in the gut—producing smaller, beneficial metabolites for the body, such as ellagic acid and various urolithins. Given the punicalagins are a novel, patented product, you won't find it in many other products, as most commercial probiotics use fermentable prebiotics, such as Fructooligosaccharide (FOS), Galactooligosaccharide (GOS), and inulin.
UROLITHIN-A OPTIONAL ADD-ON
[Optional add-on: You may be interested to know that in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial, DS-01® significantly increased Urolithin A—[a powerful molecule for healthy aging / which promotes cellular health/longevity/healthy aging]—in healthy adults, and recovery of Urolithin A in individuals experiencing occasional gut stress.
Technical audience: DS-01® is clinically validated to increase Urolithin A production in urine 1000-fold in individuals experiencing occasional gut stress (p=0.008). ]
In terms of oxalate content, each daily dose of DS-01® (2 capsules) delivers 400mg of polyphenolic bioactives. For context, according to the Oxalosis and Hyperoxaluria Foundation​, the average oxalate content per 100g of pomegranate seed and juice sacs is 78mg. This translates to .078mg oxalate per 1mg of pomegranate seeds/juice. Given that our punicalagin content is 400mg per 2 capsules, this means that the potential oxalate content would be approximately .312mg total oxalate (400 x .078) per serving. Although we don't have exact measurements, this approximate total is likely an overestimate, given our product is an extract of the plant bioactive compounds, and not the pure fruit.
For further context, a recent meta analysis reviewed several plant-based compounds for their potential role in the prevention and management of kidney stones, and the researchers found that certain pomegranate extracts demonstrated significant anti-urolithiasis effects (urolithiasis is the formation of urinary calculi or “stones”), and influenced multiple markers of kidney health—indicating that this intervention could successfully help to control the risk of renal stone formation. In addition, this pilot study demonstrated supplementation with pomegranate extract did not increase the risk of stones in those prone to developing them.
Ultimately, we do always recommend consulting with your healthcare provider whenever considering adding a new dietary supplement to your routine, especially if there are pre-existing medical conditions or health concerns, as they can best advise with your full health history in mind. ]
[OPTIONAL ADD ON if asking about Oxalate content in Leafy Greens
It is true that, many leafy greens are a concentrated source of oxalates (in addition to vitamins and minerals). This being said, not all leafy greens are equal in their oxalate content, and for individuals that would like to incorporate more of these vegetables in their diet, some lower-oxalate sources include kale, bibb lettuce, romaine, bok choy, aruga, collard, and mustard greens. Importantly, while oxalates may inhibit the absorption of some vitamins in minerals, they are also a normal end product of mammalian metabolism, and according to current research, the incorporation of higher oxalate foods as part of an overall nutritious diet should not pose any particular problems for the average healthy human. ]
CKD / Kidney Disease 


Please note that DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied in individuals living with kidney diseases or conditions; as such, we are unable to comment on any difference in effect or utility within this population.
In general, probiotics would be safe to take in those with preexisting conditions (including kidney disease); however, we would suggest a discussion with your primary care provider before incorporating any new product into your routine as they may best advise with the full knowledge of your health history.
For some background, probiotics do not enter into systemic circulation and are not metabolized by the kidney (unlike some water soluble micronutrients). Probiotics strains are transient microbes, which journey through your digestive system to your colon (where the majority of your microbiome resides) to activate systemic benefits through programmed interactions with your existing bacteria and your body (their host). This in mind, probiotics should not pose an issue for individuals with kidney disease.
[ OPTIONAL ADD-ON: You may be interested in a meta-analysis of 8 studies which investigated the role of probiotics (mainly those belonging to the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera) in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and found that positive effects were reported for some renal function markers, as well as decreases in proinflammatory cytokines. Additional long-term studies are needed to further elucidate the possible role of probiotics in the treatment of individuals with CKD. ]
[If they're asking about dialysis specifically:
There would be no need to alter the time of day you take DS-01® Daily Synbiotic depending on dialysis treament. Morning, afternoon, or evening—you know your routines and body best, so try to find a time and method that works best for you. The most important thing is consistent daily intake.
We would also not expect dialysis to have any negative impact on the probiotic organisms in DS-01®. For context, unlike micronutrients and minerals, probiotics do not enter into systemic circulation and thus would not be processed by your kidneys. They transiently move throughout your gastrointestinal tract, interacting with local cells, nutrients and resident microbes along the way.
Please feel free to defer to the expertise of your specialist or primary care provider in regards to best timing of supplements while undergoing any treatments.]
Interstitial cystitis (IC)


To start, kindly note DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied in individuals living with interstitial cystitis specifically; therefore, we are unable to comment on any difference in effect or utility within this population. DS-01® also is not considered or regulated as a therapeutic and is therefore not intended to treat or prevent any condition or disease state.
Rather, DS-01® is formulated to provide support for digestive and systemic health with core benefits across gastrointestinal function, gut barrier integrity, immune health, cardiovascular health, micronutrient synthesis, and dermatological health.
That said, I'd be happy to share with you the current research perspective on the gut microbiome and Interstitial Cystitis (IC)/Bladder Pain Syndrome (BPS).
﻿IC/BPS​ is characterized by urinary issues such as frequency, urgency, and pelvic pain. As such, early investigations of the potential impact of the microbiome in IC/BPS focused on the urinary microbiome.​ While many of these studies found differences in the urinary microbiomes of those with and without IC/BPS, these differences are not consistent​ across studies (for example, some studies found higher abundance of lactobacilli in individuals with IC/BPS, while other studies found the opposite).
Interestingly, one study also found differences in the gut microbiomes​ of those with and without IC/BPS, while another study​ used genetic analysis to determine whether these differences in gut microbiome could potentially cause IC/BPS. Though both of these studies were promising, more rigorous experimental research is needed to confirm whether targeting the gut microbiome (by using probiotics, for example) could be used to prevent or alleviate IC/BPS.
With all this said, we would ultimately recommend consulting with a physician who can provide personalized guidance based on your unique medical history and presenting symptoms. 
URINE COLOR CHANGE
Kindly note that a change in urine color would not be expected as a result of probiotic use.
However, there is a compound known as chlorophyllin in our capsules, which is used to protect the contents of the capsule from damaging effects of light. Chlorophyllin—green in color—is first extracted as chlorophyll from edible plants. While the amount of chlorophyllin present in the capsules is not expected to result in urine color change, every body is physiologically unique and the possibility of an unusual idiosyncratic reaction should not be dismissed.
It's also pertinent to note there are many factors that contribute to the quality and color of our urine​––including green urine—such as hydration​, diet​ (e.g. asparagus or certain food dyes), medications (e.g. propofol​), or even certain underlying conditions​.
Ultimately, if you feel any effects you’ve experienced may be adverse, we would encourage a discussion with your primary care physician, as they can advise with your unique health history in mind.




32. Antibiotics


Can I take DS-01® alongside antibiotics?
There are no known contraindications between probiotics and medications, so it would be generally safe to take [DS-01® / PDS-08® Pediatric] Daily Synbiotic while undergoing antibiotic therapy.
In fact, during and after antibiotic use is often considered a good time for probiotics, as numerous studies have shown their ability to mitigate GI distress—such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults and children, and to promote the resilience of a healthy gut microbiome following antibiotic therapy.
That said, probiotic efficacy depends on the type used, dose administered, and disease implicated.
Antibiotics also vary in the types of bacteria they kill depending on their pharmacologic properties and respective doses. Therefore, the effects of antibiotics on the gut microbiome are not uniform and can have ranging effects on which gut microbes they impact.
As probiotic organisms can be susceptible to being killed off by antibiotics, it may be pertinent to space your antibiotic intake as far apart from your probiotic intake as possible—by at least two hours or more.
Ultimately, we will always defer to the advice of your prescribing physician, who can advise on the entirety of your supplement and medication routine with your complete health history in mind.
[OPTIONAL ADD ON to pitch DS-01 Abx study: refer to Can you tell me about the findings from your trial on antibiotic recovery?]
Should I increase my DS-01® dose to re-colonize the gut?
If needed, refer to Can I take more than the recommended daily dose of DS-01®? ﻿
While taking more than two capsules daily is generally considered safe, there may not necessarily be any added benefit—even while taking an antibiotic course. In fact, evidence suggests that probiotic organisms are transient and generally do not colonize (or repopulate) the gut, even after antibiotic therapy.
This is not to say that probiotics aren’t beneficial within the context of antibiotic recovery. While probiotic strains have been shown to promote the resilience of a healthy gut microbiome following antibiotic therapy, they do this through specific interactions with resident microbes and local cells rather than colonizing the gut.
Further, the recommended daily dose for DS-01® (two capsules per day) is based on the dosages used for each strain in their respective clinical and scientific studies.
As such, the best dose is generally the one that has been shown in human clinical trials to produce the intended health benefits.






33. Postbiotics


Are there any known benefits of postbiotics that aren’t covered by prebiotics and probiotics?:
[OPTIONAL ADD-ON 1: Background information on probiotics vs. postbiotics]
In general, postbiotics may confer some of the same health benefits as a probiotic. This in mind, current literature suggests that the boundary between probiotics and postbiotics is blurred in some trials, as their impact on the host is often not evaluated separately. Further research is warranted to determine the distinctive relationship between probiotics and postbiotics and how they may interact.  
That said, all probiotics do not carry ‘postbiotic’ effects and the two -biotics are classified differently. In addition, a postbiotic is not needed for a probiotic to confer its intended health benefits on its host (and vise versa).
The molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of postbiotics seem to be mediated through an interaction between the host and microbial products, though various other interactions have been proposed. Most notably, it is thought that postbiotics trigger the host immune system, to activate anti-inflammatory responses, which may be beneficial in certain scenarios, or disease states where inflammatory markers may be elevated (e.g., pathogens, or metabolic endotoxemia as a result of poor systemic health/lifestyles).
It is important to note that much of the research which has currently been conducted on postbiotics has been mainly focused on in vitro work—so mechanisms of action leading to various possible benefits in human subjects have not been fully elucidated. In sum, the combined efforts of various instances of in vitro research has proved illustrative and informative as to how postbiotics may act in the human host.
This said, though there is limited data on orally administered postbiotics in humans, some preliminary studies suggest that certain postbiotics may reduce diarrhea​, as well as alleviate symptoms​ associated with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), including abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, or changes in regularity. However, in one study in which individuals with obstructive jaundice were administered both the probiotic (live) and postbiotic (inactivated) versions of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 299v (formerly known as Lactobacillus plantarum), it was found that there were no benefits with respect to gut barrier function modulation in the group that received treatment with the postbiotic (inactivated L. plantarum 299v).
With regards to the effects of postbiotics on different causes of diarrhea and gastrointestinal functioning, the use of postbiotics appears to be safe and studies with postbiotics show positive effects of the postbiotic product, particularly in adults (1, 2, 3). On the other hand, postbiotic use in children may warrant caution, as some data suggests that supplementation may result in adverse gastrointestinal symptoms and diarrhea.
This in mind, postbiotics may be considered as a useful option if the bacterial organism involved has beneficial properties, but might be unsafe if introduced alive—for example, in immunocompromised individuals.
For example, an in-vitro study demonstrated that when viable Lactobacillus casei Zhang (LcZ), isolated from koumiss, was administered to RAW264.7 macrophages (a type of immune cell engineered to study inflammatory pathways in-vitro), there was an increase in the production of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and interferon (IFN)-β. Interestingly, however, when non-viable, heat-killed LcZ was administered to these same macrophages, there was a significant decrease (or attenuation) of the immunostimulating effects noted with use of viable LcZ.
[OPTIONAL ADD-ON 2: Expanding on interactions with microbial communities, and production of metabolites]
Finally, postbiotics are often easier to produce than probiotics, since keeping bacteria alive for long periods of time under conditions such as the human GI tract is challenging (without the correct delivery system).
[OPTIONAL CLOSING]: If you're interested in learning more about the differences between various '-biotics'—you can check out our Cultured Article on the topic, here​.
[OPTIONAL ADD ON 1: Background information on probiotics vs. postbiotics ]
To begin, it would be helpful to start with some context surrounding the definition of probiotics vs. postbiotics.
Probiotics are defined by The International Scientific Association of Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) as “live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host.”
In contrast, a postbiotic is defined by ISAPP as a “preparation of inanimate microorganisms and/or their components that confers a health benefit on the host”. It is important to note that though they are inanimate (non-viable), postbiotic organisms are not inactive—there is no loss of function.
That said, the term “postbiotic” can be viewed as an umbrella term for various microbial components which are essentially by-products of live probiotic bacteria. To elaborate, “postbiotic” refers to substances derived after microorganisms are no longer alive (inanimate/dead/heat-killed); thus, the microbes comprising a postbiotic may be inanimate cells which are still or could even be structural fragments of microbes (i.e., cell walls).
Further, effective postbiotics must contain microbial cells or cell components (e.g. structural fragments of microbes like cell walls), that contribute to observed health benefits. That said, several postbiotic preparations can include microbe-produced substances, such as metabolites, proteins, or peptides—which may all contribute to the overall health effect conferred by a postbiotic.                                                                      
It’s important to note, a postbiotic must also be derived from well-defined microorganism component(s) where their genomic sequences are known and can be prepared for standardization. Further, the characterization of these genomic sequences must be made before the postbiotic organisms are rendered inanimate—via methods such as heat-killing.
Of note, the loss of viability may be the direct correlation between a probiotic and a postbiotic, however, a dead probiotic does not automatically satisfy the definition of a postbiotic. Probiotics may produce ‘postbiotic-like’ metabolites, and in some cases, it may be assumed that they work symbiotically to confer health benefits on the host. It may be hypothesized that inanimate (aka dead) cells—that may or may not satisfy the definition of a postbiotic—present in some probiotic products prior to consumption may participate in the overall health benefit(s) expected for said probiotic product.
Lastly, many commercial products claim they contain postbiotics; however, they fall short of the actual definition. For example, a product which claims a synthetic chemical is a “postbiotic” simply because it helps the downstream production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) isn’t following the actual definition of a postbiotic. Instead, the proposed postbiotic should be derived from microbial origin in order to qualify as a true postbiotic.
[OPTIONAL ADD-ON 2: Expanding on interactions with microbial communities, and production of metabolites]
In addition to providing specific benefits, such as relief from symptoms or modulating important health-related biomarkers, postbiotic products have been thought to interact with specific microbial communities and alter their structure.
For instance, the consumption of SCFAs (fermentation products from indigestible fibers) encourages cross-feeding by host-native species which may result in other, different SCFAs.
B-vitamins are not only necessary cofactors for human metabolic reactions and often taken in the form of supplemental vitamins, but can also be produced by certain species of bacteria which are not always found in the human gut, or are only present in insignificant quantities.
Another postbiotic compound, exopolysaccharides (EPS), may modulate the gut microbial composition and activity within the host. Some EPS polymers can be used as fermentable substrates by commensals, into metabolites which have been shown elsewhere to provide benefit to the host and encourage the growth of traditionally thought of helpful species like B. longum, thus demonstrating that they have bifidogenic effects, as well as L. acidophilus. To note, however, no human intervention studies have been performed to confirm these effects on the microbial community interactions described in-vitro. The aforementioned postbiotic compounds have typically been studied for their effects in-vitro, while adult human intervention studies reporting changes in microbiota in using postbiotics are scarce. That said, one study showed significant increase in propionic acid, butyrate, and valeric acid upon supplementation with a non-viable probiotic, resulting in a significant increase in Clostridium cluster IV.
Is it safe to take Postbiotics with [DS-01®/PDS-08®]? / Why doesn't [DS-01®/PDS-08®] contain postbiotics?
There are no known contraindications between probiotics and other dietary supplements; therefore, DS-01® should be fine to combine with supplements, such as postbiotics.
[If asking why DS-01®/PDS-08® does not contain postbiotics] :
To answer this question, let’s first dig into what postbiotics are: non-living microbes and/or their parts that provide a health benefit. To make postbiotics, microbes are killed or broken up (using heat, electricity, or a wide range of other methods) and processed––they are sometimes even added to food or formula.
Postbiotics are a promising area of study as they may benefit gut health and immunity, while in some cases, offering more shelf stability and resistance to digestion than live probiotics.
That said, postbiotics are still a relatively new area of study, and most studies on their safety and benefits––while promising––were done in cells or in animals, not in humans.
[ADD ON OPTION 1 - why DS-01® contains live strains]: As you noted, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic does not contain postbiotics; it instead includes 24 live probiotic strains from the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera. We focused primarily on human-derived strains with a robust history of mechanistic and clinical evidence that were expected to have benefits for the average healthy adult; as such, our strains have been clinically and scientifically studied to provide benefits for gastrointestinal function, gut barrier integrity, cardiovascular health, gut immune function, micronutrient synthesis, dermatological health, gut microbial balance and gut metabolite balance.
[ADD ON OPTION 2 - how DS-01® circumvents the survival issue that postbiotics are meant to solve: In addition, our patented delivery technology, ViaCap®, acts as an elegant barrier to oxygen, moisture, and heat to safeguard and ensure the viability of the probiotic inner capsule. When we tested DS-01® in the Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME®)—the premier simulated human intestinal microbial ecosystem assessment tool—ViaCap® was able to withstand the harmful pH of the stomach and enable precision delivery of viable cells at the end of the simulated ileum (small intestine) for delivery to the colon. In short: the ViaCap® system incidentally addresses the shelf-stability and digestion-sensitivity problems that postbiotics are often designed to avoid.
[ADD ON OPTION 3 - will Seed use postbiotics in the future: With all of this in mind, while postbiotics do have some great potential pending clinical trials, we currently do not have plans to alter our current [DS-01®/PDS-08®] formulation, as this is the formula being studied in our clinical trials as a part of our continued work with the FDA. (However, we do have an extensive pipeline of products planned which will come in a variety of delivery systems and target a variety of microbial sites and systems, so please stay tuned for future products to come.)
[ADD ON OPTION 4 - Are there any known benefits of postbiotics that aren’t covered by prebiotics and probiotics?]:
In general, postbiotics may confer some of the same health benefits as a probiotic.
This said, though there is limited data on orally administered postbiotics in humans, some preliminary studies suggest that certain postbiotics may reduce diarrhea​, as well as alleviate symptoms​ associated with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), including abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, or changes in regularity. However, one study noted that there were no benefits in terms of the modulation of gut barrier function in a specific clinical population. You can read more about these postbiotic studies in this review​ by The International Scientific Association of Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP).
Further, postbiotics may be considered as a useful option if the bacterial organism involved has beneficial properties, but might be unsafe if introduced alive.
Finally, postbiotics are often easier to produce than probiotics, since keeping bacteria alive for long periods of time under conditions such as the human GI tract is challenging (without the correct delivery system).

34. yogurt 
Can I use DS-01® as a yogurt/fermentation starter?
Kindly note, we do not recommend opening DS-01® Daily Synbiotic capsules and using their content as a yogurt or fermentation starter. This is because probiotics are live, beneficial organisms that are vulnerable to environmental factors such as oxygen, moisture, and light. The DS-01® capsule, termed ViaCap®, is specially designed to protect the fragile probiotic organisms from these environmental factors and support probiotic potency and viability through the digestive process for delivery to the colon–the site of probiotic activity.
With this known, we would be unable to say if the probiotic strains in DS-01® would remain viable, when removed from their protective capsule and used as a yogurt starter.
[OPTIONAL ADD ON for email only, if asking about whether DS could work to make yogurt: Furthermore, using DS-01® to make yogurt may not yield the desired results.
For some context, while DS-01® comprises 24 live bacterial strains​, only certain types of bacteria produce enough lactic acid (the substance that makes milk curdle or thicken). Generally, species within the genus Lactobacillus convert lactose (milk sugar) to lactic acid, but not all species can do so as effectively or at all. In fact, other common genera of bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium, would not grow and produce significant amounts of lactic acid in this environment; therefore, strains from this genus would likely fail to curdle milk or produce yogurt. To clarify, the DS-01® formulation includes probiotic strains from both the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera.
Additionally, in the fermentation processes, typically used to make fermented foods like yogurt, one or two strains are often used in culture—which is in opposition to a multi-strain probiotic like DS-01®.]
Fermented Food / Bevs vs Probiotics 
Version 1 (summary / most simple)
Many fermented foods and beverages can be nutritious, tasty additions to your daily diet.
That said, just because something contains live microorganisms doesn’t mean it satisfies the definition of a probiotic—which requires the microorganisms to be alive at the time of consumption, to have a demonstrated health benefit, and to be administered in specific amounts.
In contrast, fermented foods generally do not conduct testing to confirm the specific strains present in their products—and thus cannot reliably relate benefits, as these are strain-specific—nor do they confirm whether a specific strain is present in an adequate dosage, or whether the bacteria are even alive upon consumption. This is why the microorganisms in fermented food or beverages are generally said to be live dietary microbes, which do not require any specific characterization, nor do they have any scientific evidence directly linking their use to a conferred health benefit.
So, while fermented foods and beverages can be a great addition to your diet, it is important to keep in mind that they may not confer the same benefits that a scientifically-validated probiotic supplement may. If you’d like to dive deeper into this topic, check out our cultured article on this topic, here.
[OPTIONAL ADD ON - "I heard live probiotics are better": It's true that probiotics are most effective when they make it to your colon, alive. DS-01® does include live probiotics (they are simply lyophilized––similar to freeze-dried––and reactivate when they come in contact with water). We've also done extensive testing to make sure these live probiotics survive shipping, storage, and digestion for precision delivery to your colon at clinically relevant dosages.
Version 2 (deeper explanation)
While it's certainly possible for a fermented food or beverage to meet the scientific criteria for a probiotic, most fall short, and therefore do not fall under this category or supply the same benefits.
For some context, the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) defines a probiotics “live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host.”
Relating this to a fermented food–while you may have ingested some bacteria from this, it’s typically unknown which strains, in which quantities, whether these strains are alive at the time of consumption, and if they have been studied, in those quantities, to actually have a benefit to your body. More likely than not, consuming fermented foods is a source of live dietary microbes, rather than being characterized as a probiotic.
This is not to say that you shouldn’t eat or drink fermented things. Many fermented foods and beverages are extremely nutritious, very tasty additions to your daily diet. The greatest distinction between a probiotic supplement and live dietary microbes from fermented foods is that the foods are not necessarily reliable sources of beneficial, effective, and live bacteria in adequate amounts—many fermented foods would have to be consumed in relatively large quantities in order to generate a potential health benefit.
All said, fermented foods can be a great addition to your diet—though, it is important to keep in mind, they may not necessarily confer the same benefits a scientifically-studied probiotic supplement will.
Version 3 (deepest + most scientific)
While it's certainly possible for a fermented food or beverage to meet the scientific criteria for a probiotic, most fall short. For some context, the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) definition of a probiotic is “live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host.”
While you may have ingested some bacteria from eating a fermented food, it’s typically unknown which strains, in which quantities, if the strains are still alive at the time of consumption, and if those strains have been studied, in those quantities, to actually have a benefit to your body. More likely than not, consuming fermented foods is a source of live dietary microbes, rather than being characterized as a probiotic.
Live dietary microbes (LDM) do not require any specific characterization, nor do the have scientific evidence which demonstrates a specific health benefit. Further, there is no defined dose–in fact, LDMs would need to be consumed in large quantities to generate a potential health benefit.
It is also important to understand that most fermented foods are made with live microbes, but some processing steps may kill or remove the live microbes.
All of this in mind, this is not to say that you shouldn’t eat or drink fermented things–many fermented foods and beverages are extremely nutritious, very tasty additions to your daily diet.
The best sources of live dietary microbes are raw vegetables and fruit (unpeeled), and fermented dairy and vegetables (untreated after fermentation), which contain low amounts of added sugars, and are found in the refrigerated section of a market.
Interestingly, one study actually found that a group of individuals who steadily increased their consumption to 4-6 servings of fermented foods (including: fermented dairy products, fermented vegetables, fermented non-alcoholic drinks) per day, over a 10 week intervention period, saw both an increase in their microbiota diversity and a decrease in numerous markers of inflammation. However, the sample size of this study was low and further human studies are needed to examine the causality of this relationship.
All said, a diet rich in fermented foods can be a great addition to your diet—though, it is important to keep in mind, they may not necessarily confer the same benefits a scientifically-studied probiotic supplement will.

﻿General strain specificity education
Version 1 (summary / most simple)
It is important to emphasize that benefits for probiotic organisms are strain-specific. This is because benefits are clinically assessed + demonstrated at the strain level; and, due to the significant variance between strains, this data cannot simply be applied beyond the strain studied.
For some context, Bifidobacterium is what’s called a genus—that is, a ‘group’. Within each genus, such as the Bifidobacterium genus, there can be multiple species, such as Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium breve. Then, within each species of bacteria, there are strains (like Bifidobacterium longum SD-BB536-JP, Bifidobacterium longum HRVD90b-US, etc.).
There can be hundreds, or even thousands, of strains in a single species. And just like a golden retriever and a french bulldog (both categorized as Canis lupus familiaris species) are incredibly different, these strains of bacteria can also vary significantly.
This is why data (e.g. benefits) collected on a single strain cannot simply be extrapolated across an entire genus or species—and why strain specificity is an important topic in probiotics, as strains are directly related to effects.
Version 2 (deeper explanation)
The concept of biological taxonomy is the science of classification or categorization. In this system, organisms are classified in different levels based on similar characteristics, beginning with grouping based on the most broad characteristics (domain) all the way down to the most specific ones (species). Within these levels, there is a genus which is a higher, more broad category (ex: genus Bifidobacterium), with each genus containing multiple species (ex: species Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium breve, etc.); and each species in turn containing multiple strains (ex: Bifidobacterium longum SD-BB536-JP, Bifidobacterium longum HRVD90b-US, etc.). Out of these three categories, strain is the most specific and narrow category.
Now, [relating this back to the probiotic definition] we can see how the importance of strain specificity comes in, as the evidence of health benefits is assessed at the strain-level. And, because of the depth of variance between each strain in a given species (and each species in a given genus), the results of these strain studies can not simply be extrapolated across an entire species or genus.
﻿
[OPTIONAL ADD ON re products: In considering the consumer world, this means that if the evidence of a demonstrated health benefit is established on a strain-level, then a product identifying only a genus or species of microorganism could not accurately claim there is evidence that any benefit would be demonstrated with its use.]
Why does your Lactobacillus name look different / I can't find XX species/strain in your list?
In 2020, the genus Lactobacillus underwent some naming changes​ to better classify bacteria within the genus according to updated information from whole genome sequencing. For example, Lactobacillus reuteri was reclassified​ into Limosilactobacillus reuteri. The bacteria themselves have not changed, only the name. Thus, these two names are synonymous with one using the updated classification and the other using the older classification.
[If asking about Seed specific strain naming: (NOTE: this does not apply to the HRVDXX strains)
In regards to how strains are listed on our label, it may be slightly different than how they are mentioned in the literature.
Taking Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus SD-GG-BE for example—"SD" represents “Seed”, "GG" is the name often found in literature, and "BE" represents where the strain is banked which in this case is Belgium. In the literature, it will often simply be described as Lacticaseibacillus (or Lactobacillus) rhamnosus GG. ]

Osteoarthritis
Research has shown that the gut microbiota plays a role in​ bone metabolism and the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. Although targeted bone health-specific probiotic applications do not currently exist, probiotics may offer the potential for gut microbiome modulation as an intervention for gut-bone signaling.
For context, the gut microbiome is strongly intertwined with the regulation of bone structure through its role in calcium absorption. Permeability of the gut lining and the associated inflammatory response is hypothesized to play a main role in this process. In a hormone-deficient mouse model, the common Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG strain was shown to decrease intestinal permeability and protect against bone loss. Further studies in rats showed prevention of hormone-induced bone loss with administration of L. helveticus or L. reuteri strains.
However, studies in humans so far have not always been as clear cut: a 2018﻿ study showed that strain L. reuteri 6475 reduced bone loss in older women—but a 2017 study determined that a multi-strain probiotic provided a significant decrease in bone turnover, yet no improvement in bone density.
Therefore, further research is needed on specific strains (and strain combinations), dosages, and mechanisms of probiotic applications for osteoporosis in humans.

[OPTIONAL add-on: At this time we do not have plans to make a probiotic for this indication specifically. That said, we do have an extensive pipeline of products planned which will come in a variety of delivery systems targeting a variety of microbial sites and systems so please stay tuned for future products to come! ]
L plantarum - additional research aside from what’s provided above
Electrolytes
To start, there are no known contraindications between DS-01® and other dietary supplements; therefore, DS-01® would generally be considered safe to combine with other supplements, including LMNT's Electrolyte Drink Mix, as well as consume at the same time.
For some context and to possibly address any concerns as it relates to salt/electrolyte intake alongside probiotics, this study​ found that a daily salt intake of 5,500 mg reduced the intestinal survival of Lactobacillus species, of which DS-01® is partially comprised. Additionally, this study​ found that L. plantarum strains—DS-01® contains two (L. plantarum SD-LP1-IT and SD-LPLDL-UK)—could survive salt concentrations of up to 6 percent.
That said, [ LMNT: one packet of LMNT's Electrolyte Drink Mix contains 1,000 mg of sodium ], leaving it well below the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's recommendation​ of 2,300 mg per day (though, of course, your overall daily consumption would be included in that number) as well as the 5,500 mg reported in the study mentioned above.
[ For LMNT, specifically: Moreover, if you mixed one packet of LMNT's Electrolyte Drink Mix in 16 ounces of water (LMNT's minimum recommended amount), this would come to a 0.21% concentration of sodium, which is also well below the 6% limit for L. plantarum. Therefore, the amount of salt in your electrolyte drink is unlikely to have a deleterious effect on the probiotics in DS-01®, and would generally be considered safe to take concurrently. ]
With all of the above in mind, it is important to note that there is no universal best way to take DS-01®. The most important factor is consistent daily intake, so we encourage you to pursue a method and routine that works best for you as long as it is well-tolerated by your body. If you feel more comfortable spacing out your DS-01® and electrolyte drink intake, you could try leaving a gap of at least two hours or more. For example, you could take your electrolyte drink in the morning (or whenever is best advised by your physician) while taking DS-01® before bed (at least 2-3 hours after dinner).
All said, we would also suggest consulting with your health care provider to determine the best course of action regarding your supplement routine.
﻿Tyramine sensitivity
Note to SciCare specialists: Tyramine sensitivity is often mentioned in conjunction with histamine intolerance, for which we have these cards: Can I take DS-01 if I have a histamine intolerance? / Has DS-01 been studied in individuals with a histamine intolerance? and Histamine Producing Strains / Histamine Production ﻿
Version 1 (summary / most simple)
Kindly note, tyramine levels were not one of the endpoints for which DS-01® was formulated, nor has DS-01® been tested in those with tyramine sensitivity; we are therefore unable to comment on any difference in effect, utility, or safety in this regard.
That said, I'd be happy to share the current research perspective on tyramine and the gut microbiome.
In general, tyramine​ increases the release of other neurotransmitters (such as norepinephrine or dopamine); in high amounts, this can lead to headaches, blood pressure spikes, or other unfavorable health outcomes, though at low levels, it may also help regulate ​the immune and nervous system.
Interestingly, different strains within the same species of bacteria can have opposite effects on tyramine. For example, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum has been shown to both increase​ and decrease​ tyramine levels in foods. However, the impact of probiotic strains on tyramine levels has primarily been tested in vitro or in foods, rather than in humans. Thus, rigorous human clinical trials are needed to determine how probiotics could potentially affect tyramine levels in humans.
With all of this in mind, we would encourage you to consult with your personal physician to assess your degree of [histamine intolerance and] tyramine sensitivity and to advise on the need for avoiding certain strains of probiotics.
