## VS-01™ Vaginal Synbiotic

## Overview

The vaginal microbiome is the foundation of gynecological, urogenital, and reproductive health. However, day-to-day life including menstruation, sexual activity, exercise, stress, certain prescriptions and cleaners, can easily disrupt the vaginal microbiome, leaving it susceptible to imbalances and unwanted issues. Core discoveries over the past two decades have demonstrated that optimal vaginal health is primarily maintained by the dominance of a single bacterial species:

*L. crispatus*.

Born from 15+ years of leading vaginal microbiome research, VS-01™ is the first vaginal suppository with three proprietary *Lactobacillus crispatus* strains, clinically validated to restore a healthy vaginal microbiome, sustain optimal vaginal pH, and is demonstrated to be well-tolerated in a clinical setting[1].

VS-01™ is formulated with three live strains of *L. crispatus* (LUCA103™, LUCA011™, LUCA009™) selected from a proprietary bank of over 600 microbial strains, based on their strong association with vaginal microbiome stability and resilience[1].

An innovative nutrient complex was included to create the ideal environment and energy source for the probiotic strains in VS-01™. By providing *L. crispatus* a growth advantage over other less beneficial species in the vagina, VS-01™'s ingredient complex ensures that these protective bacteria not only survive, but thrive[1].

## Formulation

### CST-1™ Probiotic Ecology

*L. crispatus* LUCA103™, *L. crispatus* LUCA011™, *L. crispatus* LUCA009™

Probiotic Ecology of three live probiotic strains representative of naturally occurring *L. crispatus* genomic diversity and associated with vaginal microbiome stability were selected from our proprietary strain bank of over 600 microbial strains[1].

### CST-1™ Nutrient Complex

Maltose, Calcium Lactate, Glutamine, DiBasic Magnesium Citrate, Cystine

A complex of nutrients and molecules was specifically selected to create the ideal environment and energy source for our CST-1™ Probiotic Ecology. By providing *L. crispatus* a growth advantage over other less beneficial species in your vagina, our complex ensures that these protective bacteria not only survive, but thrive[1].

### Other Ingredients

Magnesium Stearate (plant-derived), Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose (HPMC) (naturally-derived), Cellulose (naturally-derived)

Chemically inactive excipients to support tablet formation, stabilization, or dissolution profiles. HPMC and Cellulose are both naturally derived from wood pulp[1].

## Directions for Use

### How to Use

**Prepare:** Wash your hands and gently press a VS-01™ vaginal tablet out of the aluminum pack.
**Load:** Place the tablet into the applicator. The tablet is in the correct place when it's protruding halfway out of the applicator.
**Insert:** Insert the applicator into your vagina and push the inner tube towards you to release (just like a tampon).
**Dispose:** Dispose of the applicator in the trash. Note that each applicator is a Class I Medical Device and cannot be recycled[1].

*VS-01™ requires your body's natural lubrication for proper dissolution, and therefore may not be as effective among women experiencing significant vaginal dryness.*[1]

### Protocol

**For Optimal Seeding-Reset**

Begin VS-01™ Reset––a clinically-validated protocol to seed an optimal vaginal microbiome and maintain vaginal pH within one month[1].

If you menstruate regularly, start Day 1 immediately after your period when bleeding stops (spotting is okay). If you do not menstruate regularly, you may start at any time[1].

Continue on Days 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28[1].

If you miss a day, simply resume as soon as possible[1].

**For Ongoing Protection-Sustain**

Continue VS-01™ monthly to support maintenance of a stable vaginal microbiome and protect against pH disruptors from lifestyle and the environment[1].

If you menstruate regularly, start Day 1 immediately after your period when bleeding stops (spotting is okay), and the second vaginal tablet on Day 14. If you do not menstruate regularly, you may start Day 1 at any time[1].

If you miss a day, simply resume as soon as possible[1].

*Acclimation*

When first starting VS-01™, acclimation can be a common and anticipated experience. Symptoms such as vaginal discharge, mild-to-moderate irritation, or minor cramping may occur shortly after inserting the first vaginal tablet. These effects will normalize as your body adjusts to the protocol. If you are concerned about any potentially unwanted or negative effects, consult with your physician[1].

*Menses*

It is recommended that you do not use VS-01™ while experiencing moderate to heavy bleeding, in order to allow the VS-01™ vaginal tablet to fully dissolve in the vagina and maximize absorption. Generally, Day 1 of each protocol starts as soon as bleeding stops[1].

Note that it is completely fine to insert VS-01™ while spotting or experiencing light bleeding[1].

If you experience breakthrough bleeding, 3 hours | Every lot |
| Organoleptic evaluation | White-to-beige oblong tablets. Neutral aroma. | Every lot |
| Friability | 90 days) use by healthy individuals. Results also demonstrate no reproductive or developmental concerns[1].

### Osmolality Testing

Osmolality is the number of moles of dissolved particles per kg of water (units mOsm). High osmolality indicates a high concentration of solutes in a solution. Normal vaginal fluid ranges between 300-400 mOsm[1].

Most vaginal lubricants are hyperosmolar (>2000 mOsm), can cause vaginal epithelial cell death, and loss of barrier integrity in 3-D tissue models. Epithelial damage can increase the risk of infection. Based on third-party laboratory testing with a GLP-compliant quality system, VS-01™ falls under the World Health Organization's (WHO) established upper limit (1200mOsm) for osmolality[1].

### Vaginal Tissue Model (MatTek) Testing

We subjected VS-01™ to an FDA-recognized tissue culture model derived from healthy, human-derived vaginal epithelial and dendritic cells. Its highly-differentiated structure parallels *in vivo* vaginal tissue to better understand how products impact the vaginal epithelium. Testing revealed that VS-01™ preserves the integrity of the vaginal epithelial barrier without triggering inflammatory responses. This approach not only reflects our dedication to ethical research practices but also underscores our commitment to developing products that are safe and beneficial for vaginal health[1].

## Interactions

### Medications + Pre-existing Conditions

VS-01™ would generally be suitable to take alongside most prescribed or over-the-counter medications as there are no known contraindications between medications and probiotics, prebiotics or postbiotics. That said, if you are currently taking medication for an existing vaginal infection or concern, follow the standard of care prescribed and introduce VS-01™ as directed by your doctor[1].

Ultimately, we always recommend consulting with a prescribing physician regarding incorporating VS-01™ into your routine alongside any medications or pre-existing conditions[1].

### Pregnancy + Preconception

As with any new product contemplated during pregnancy, or pre-conception, we always recommend a conversation with a physician or obstetrician before trying VS-01™[1].
