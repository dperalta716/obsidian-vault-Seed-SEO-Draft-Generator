# PDS-08® Pediatric Daily Synbiotic Reference

PDS-08® comprises 9 clinically studied probiotic strains with a dual-phase prebiotic. This breakthrough formulation is paired with innovations in probiotic stabilization and precision release to deliver strains to the lower small intestine in children to support gut and systemic benefits, including digestive, skin, and respiratory health. Non-stimulant and non-habit-forming.\[1\]

## Directions for Use

Consistent, daily use is important to activate the PDS-08® benefits for your child. The PDS-08® experience is designed with simplicity and "how-do-I-get-my-kid-to-do-this-daily" in mind.\[1\]

1. **Pour 1 sachet into room temperature food or drink.** Bacteria are fragile—to preserve viability, mix powder into a cold or room temperature soft food (yogurt, fruit puree) or liquid (water, milk).\[1\]  
     
2. **Mix well until fully dissolved.** Stir powder into food until well distributed. If mixing into liquid, be sure to shake well in a closed bottle. Please do not use a blender or food processor. Once mixed, do not heat food or drink.\[1\]  
     
3. **Try to consume the full dose within 30 minutes.** Once powder is in contact with food or drink, consume as soon as possible to optimize the full benefits.\[1\]  
     
4. **Repeat and track, daily.** To ensure your child doesn't miss a day, twist the BacTrac™ container top to align the dot (- ) and day so you always remember the last date of use.\[1\]

Note: Your child may experience a temporary acclimation period—some gastrointestinal discomfort, abdominal tightness, mild nausea, or changes in their stool. This is normal. If your child is prone to digestive sensitivity, start with a half dose for the first 3-5 days.\[1\]

## Clinical Trials

**PDS-08® in Pediatric Bowel Function**

PDS-08® Pediatric Daily Synbiotic is a proprietary 2-in-1 powdered synbiotic with 9 clinically studied probiotic strains and over 6 grams of mixed-chain length prebiotic blend, formulated for benefits in and beyond the gut.\[1\]

Constipation afflicts about 25% of children visiting pediatric gastroenterologist practices in the United States, with symptoms frequently persisting into adolescence and adulthood despite treatment with laxatives.\[1\]

In a clinical study, 64 children (3-17 years of age) were randomized to receive PDS-08® (n=33) or placebo (n=31) for 84 days. Key findings:

- Children with low bowel movement frequency administered PDS-08® significantly increased in number of Weekly Bowel Movements (WBMs)  
- The product was safe and well tolerated, with no adverse events reported  
- Bacterial strains from PDS-08® were detectable at high concentrations in treated individuals  
- Treated individuals showed an overall increase in *Bifidobacterium* abundance (bifidogenic effect)\[1\]

## Testing

Extensive testing is conducted on PDS-08® throughout each manufacturing step and on the final product, including:

- Whole-genome sequencing on strains  
- Flow cytometry to measure viable cells  
- Survivability testing for GI tract passage  
- Heat and humidity testing  
- Over 50 quality assurance and quality control checkpoints\[1\]

The final product is tested for 500+ different pesticides (including glyphosate) and 14 of the most common allergens. Probiotic strains have GRAS and/or QPS status for safety.\[1\]

### Quality Control Testing Battery

**Microbiological Data** (tested each batch):

- Yeasts and molds: ≤100 CFU/g  
- Enterobacteria: ≤100 CFU/g  
- Total coliforms: ≤3 MPN/g  
- E. coli: Absent/1 g  
- Salmonella: Absent/25 g  
- Staphylococcus coagulase positive: ≤10 CFU/g  
- Listeria monocytogenes: Absent/25 g\[1\]

**Probiotic Potency** (tested each batch):

- Sum total of all viable Seed PDS-08™ strains: ≥24.5 Billion AFU/serving\[1\]

**Heavy Metals Testing** (tested each batch):

- Arsenic: \<1.00 ppm  
- Lead: \<0.079 ppm  
- Cadmium: \<0.651 ppm  
- Mercury: \<0.048 ppm\[1\]

**Other Testing**:

- AMPA and Glyphosate (quarterly)  
- Pesticides/Biocides \[500+ different chemicals\] (quarterly)  
- Allergen testing (quarterly)  
- Thermostability (2x per year)  
- Digestive survivability (validated)\[1\]

## Interactions

There are no known contraindications with PDS-08® and medications; therefore, it is generally safe to take alongside other prescription or over-the-counter medications.\[1\]

If your child is undergoing antibiotic treatment, it's recommended to space the antibiotics as far from the probiotics as possible (e.g., one in the morning and one in the evening) since probiotics are susceptible to being killed by antibiotics.\[1\]

Always consult with a doctor or family physician regarding prescription medications to ensure they can advise with complete knowledge of your child's health history.\[1\]
