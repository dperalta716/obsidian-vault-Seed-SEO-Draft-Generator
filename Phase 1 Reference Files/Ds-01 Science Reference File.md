### Microbiota-Accessible Polyphenolic Precursors™ [MAPP]

400mg

Indian Pomegranate [whole fruit] (*Punica granatum*) (>40% Polyphenolic + Phenolic Bioactives)

## Directions for Use

Take 1 capsule daily for the first three days.

On day four (or when you're ready), increase to the full dose of 2 capsules at once, daily. Ideally, take both capsules on an empty stomach or at least 10 minutes prior to a meal.

*Fig. 1* — Acclimation protocol

Just as with any new diet, product, or change, you may experience a temporary acclimation period—some gastrointestinal discomfort, abdominal tightness, mild nausea, or changes in your stool. This can be very normal. In fact, an immediate physiological reaction is a sign that our probiotics are viable and attuning to your system. Any discomfort should subside within the first few weeks of consistent use.

If the discomfort does not subside, you may try experimenting with your DS-01® use. Try taking the capsules with food or one capsule in the morning and one in the evening.

## Clinical Trials

### DS-01® in Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)

The objective of this placebo-controlled study is to assess the effect of the 24-strain Daily Synbiotic (SH-DS01) on the composition and metabolism of the intestinal microbiota as well as to evaluate a range of IBS symptoms in a cohort of 100 subjects with constipation—predominant (IBS-C) or mixed (IBS-M) irritable bowel syndrome. This study will be conducted under an Investigational New Drug application, as authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration. This is a requirement for testing dietary supplements among persons with chronic conditions or diseases.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder that is commonly seen in clinical practice. Specifically, it is a functional bowel disorder that is thought to result from a disorder of the gut–brain interaction. Though patients with IBS often have a heterogeneous symptom profile, the predominant theme is the presence of abdominal pain or discomfort that is usually relieved by defecation. Genetic background and environmental factors are important for the pathogenesis of IBS, but the precise cause of IBS is still unknown. The long-term goal of our study is to assess the functional impact of probiotics in subjects who suffer from gastrointestinal symptoms and have been diagnosed with IBS-C or IBS-M. Thus far, few studies have been conducted to objectively assess the impact of ingesting live microorganisms on the symptoms of IBS-C or IBS-M such as gas / bloating.

This protocol aims to assess the impact of a mix of 24-beneficial strains on individual gastrointestinal symptoms in a cohort of subjects with IBS-C or IBS-M. The design of this protocol is unique, as we are not only collecting urine, blood, and fecal tissue to assess mechanism of action, but we will also ask the subjects recruited to use a smartphone application to report day-to-day gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating. This trial is being conducted at Harvard's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and began recruitment in 2020.

### Impact of DS-01® on Post-Antibiotic Recovery

The objective of this study is to assess the effect of SH-DS01 on the gut microbiota of healthy adults after taking a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

In the United States, healthcare providers prescribe over 270 million antibiotic courses each year. While antibiotics have transformed medicine and methods of treating life-threatening bacterial infection, broad spectrum antibiotics also induce disruption of resident gut microbial communities by altering both composition and function. This disruption of microbial community dynamics has been demonstrated at the taxonomic level, yet the extent of functional disruptions to microbial metabolic output and host cells remains understudied in humans. This study explores the impact of a broad spectrum antibiotic cocktail on microbial communities throughout the gastrointestinal tract, and the rescue effects of a defined, multi-strain consortia of probiotic organisms following antibiotic exposure. This trial began recruitment in Q3 2020.

#### Probiotic Potency

DS-01® measures viable cell count in AFU, or Active Fluorescent Units. AFU is measured with flow cytometry, a process where probiotic cells are tagged with fluorescent 'markers' and counted by a laser as they pass through a tube. Through AFU, we are able to calculate precise measurement of all viable cells, including ones that are efficacious but not necessarily culturable (and therefore would not be counted in a traditional plated CFU measurement).

CFU stands for Colony Forming Units, and is reflected in plating, a classical microbiology technique that has been used since the 1800s. This technique shows the number of 'colonies' that are formed on a plate through a series of dilutions. CFU can vary up to 50% between batch lots, requires different plating ingredients for each species (and sometimes strain), and is best used for single strain, rather than multi-strain synbiotics (including prebiotics).

Globally, there is a lot of discussion about current and future techniques for testing beyond CFU, including flow cytometry and q-PCR (Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction), as probiotic strains can vary widely in potency based on biofermentation and production methods (from between 50 Billion AFU / gram to 800 Billion AFU / gram). As a company committed to innovation, we are always evaluating the most effective and precise technologies, including new stabilization techniques, delivery formats, and testing methods.

Today, the use of flow cytometry and its unit of measure (AFU) not only allows us to determine viable cell counts but also allows for the counting of damaged and dead cell subpopulations. Traditional plating techniques (CFU) are limited by parameters of time, specifically the inability to detect viable but nonculturable (VBNC) micro-organisms and nonviable cells. More specifically, AFU detection is equal to or better than CFU for the following reasons: accuracy, precision (repeatability), intermediate precision (ruggedness), specificity, limit of quantification, linearity, range, and robustness.

### Heavy Metals Testing

Most supplements, fruits, vegetables, milk-derived proteins, and natural products carry some level of heavy metals, which can be very difficult to completely eliminate from the diet due to their uptake by plants from the surrounding air, water, and soil. Food and natural products are regulated in California by CA Prop 65, or "The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986", which establishes "safe harbor levels" for a list of chemicals known to the state to potentially cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. Seed abides by these stringent regulations and tests all products for the four main categories of Heavy Metals: Arsenic, Cadmium, Lead, and Mercury.

### Pesticide Testing

Our product is tested at third party accredited laboratories for over 500 pesticide residues using gas chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. We [specifically] subject DS-01® to testing for the ubiquitous pesticide, glyphosate, as well as its breakdown product, AminoMethylPhosphonic Acid (AMPA), using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. This rigorous testing protocol ensures adherence to our strict quality standards.

The full list of pesticides tested may be viewed [here](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0024/0798/9315/files/Seed_Pesticides.pdf?v=1590542890).

### Digestive Survivability Testing (SHIME®)

To evaluate the survival of our probiotics, we test with a Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME®)—the closest system developed to model human digestion and the gut. It recreates the physiological conditions and biological processes (food uptake, peristalsis, digestive enzymes, pancreatic and bile acids, and time spent in each step) representative of the human gastrointestinal tract.

At the three hour mark of incubation, the ViaCap® delivered a maximal release of probiotics maintaining the full value of the starting dose (10.57 log vs 10.60 log, or about 100%), indicating viability through the end of the small intestine for delivery into the colon. The ViaCap® was engineered for a precision release of the contents of the inner, probiotic capsule, through the small intestine, resulting in full delivery of label potency prior to entering the colon chamber.

### Thermostability Testing

Heat typically injures or kills living probiotics, but the selection of probiotic strains and the delivery system that carries them (think: capsules, powders, liquid fill) each respond differently to varying levels of heat exposure. We've tested our strains and ViaCap® capsule-in-capsule delivery system mimicking the packaging and worst-case scenario heat conditions that DS-01® could potentially encounter on its way to our customers.

Even after 10 days of constant, 24 hour, 100º F exposure, which is very unlikely even in the heat of summer, our probiotic bacteria counts and viability exceeded the living cell counts (AFU) stated on our label.

Only with constant exposure to blazing temperatures of 120ºF—continuously over 48 hours—did the total biopotency of the DS-01® dip below label claim numbers and requirements.

## Interactions

DS-01® is safe to take with other supplements and there are no known contraindications with medications. We would recommend that you also consult with your personal physician in regards to your prescription medications so that they may advise with the complete knowledge of your health history.

### Can I take too many probiotics?

Unlike with some vitamins and minerals, probiotics do not have recommended upper limits and have not been shown to reach levels of toxicity. In fact, probiotics have been clinically studied for certain indications in CFU dosages that reach the trillions. It is important to note, more is not necessarily better—the best dose per strain of probiotics is the dose that has been shown in human clinical trials to have the intended health benefit.

### Can I take DS-01® with other probiotics?

DS-01® is safe to take with other supplements, including another probiotic. There may be some functional redundancy if combining our probiotic with other microbial strains in the *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacteria* genera, but it will not hurt to do so.
