**Objective:** Generate a high-quality, SEO-optimized article (1300+ words) for Seed Health about the provided keyword. The article must be unique, deeply evidence-based (academic sources only), **strategically cited** to establish authority without excessive citation load, strictly adhere to Seed's specific scientific POV and compliance guidelines, and match the Seed brand voice.

**Input:**

* **Keyword:** The user will provide a primary keyword in the main prompt.  
* **Supporting Documents:** You have access to the following documents, which MUST be consulted and prioritized as specified:  
  * `SEO Article Sprint - SciCare POV - DS-01 - General.txt` (Highest priority for scientific perspective and Seed's stance. Referred to as `SciCare POV`)  
  * `What we are and are not allowed to say when writing for Seed.txt` (Strict compliance rules. Referred to as `Compliance Rules`)  
  * `Seed Tone of Voice and Structure.txt` (Defines brand voice and article structure. Referred to as `Tone Guide`)  
  * `8 Sample Reference Blog Articles.txt` (Examples of tone, structure, citation style. Referred to as `Sample Articles`)  
  * `Ds-01 Science Reference File.txt` (Priority source for specific strains and studies. Referred to as `DS-01 Science Ref`)  
  * `Ds-01 PDP.txt` (Product details, used sparingly/appropriately. Referred to as `DS-01 PDP`)  
  * `NO-NO WORDS.pdf` (words and phrases to avoid using at all in the draft)  
  * `SEED strains - Sheet1.pdf` (a full list of how the preferred names for seed strains. Use names from the column “Full Name (PREFERRED)” or “Abbreviated Name (PREFERRED)” when referring to a strain from seed)

**Internal Processing Guidance:**

* \*\*Step 1: Search & Initial Analysis\*\* Perform a web search for the top 5-7 ranking articles for the **Keyword**.  
* Analyze these articles to understand the common topics covered, angles taken, and standard advice given.  
* **Capture the "People Also Ask" (PAA) questions** displayed on the Google search results page for the **Keyword**. Note down 3-4 relevant PAA questions.

**Step 2: Determine User Intent & Core Questions**

* Based on Step 1, determine the primary user search intent(s) behind the **Keyword**.  
* Identify the core questions users are trying to answer when searching for this **Keyword**. What information are they *really* seeking?

**Step 3: Identify Uniqueness Opportunities via SciCare POV & Critical Analysis**

* Identify 2-3 pieces of "standard advice" or commonly accepted assumptions found in the top search results (from Step 1).  
* For each assumption:  
  * Critically evaluate it: Is there academic evidence (peer-reviewed, recent) that contradicts or nuances this? Are there important exceptions?  
  * **Crucially:** Cross-reference this assumption against the `SciCare POV` document.  
  * **If a conflict or nuance exists between common advice and `SciCare POV`:**  
    * Note the specific SciCare stance.  
    * Draft a quote (approx. 1-3 sentences) explaining Seed's perspective and reasoning, attributed to **"Dirk Gevers, Ph.D."**. **Focus on using these quotes for *significant* contrasts or to highlight core Seed philosophies.** This quote should frame Seed's view as their specific approach, not necessarily the *only* correct view (e.g., "While common advice suggests X, at Seed, our perspective, based on \[SciCare reasoning\], is Y..."). **Ensure the reasoning for the quote is backed by cited evidence (see Step 5).**  
    * **Prioritize the `SciCare POV` perspective above all other sources if there is a direct contradiction.**  
  * Plan how to integrate these SciCare contrasts, unique nuances, and expert quotes into the article to provide fresh, original value beyond a simple rehash of SERP content.

**Step 4: Develop Article Outline**

* Create a detailed H2/H3 outline for the article.  
* Structure MUST follow the `Tone Guide` recommendations (Overview, Intro, Body Sections, Key Insights, FAQs).  
* Headers should balance SEO relevance for the **Keyword** with the engaging, often question-based style described in the `Tone Guide`.  
* The outline MUST be designed to answer the core user questions (from Step 2\) and incorporate the unique angles/SciCare contrasts identified (in Step 3).

**\[REVISED\] Step 5: Gather Evidence & Identify *Key* Claims**

* **Identify essential, high-quality, evidence-backed claims** to support the core arguments and unique perspectives in the Outline (Step 4). **Focus on quality and relevance over quantity.**  
* **Citation Strategy: Cite *Key Claims*, Not Everything.** The goal is to establish authority (E-E-A-T) and support specific points without citing widely accepted foundational knowledge.  
  * **Prioritize citing the following *Key Claims*:**  
    * **Specific Study Results:** Findings from clinical trials, reviews, meta-analyses (especially those in `DS-01 Science Ref` or recent high-quality studies). Cite the study directly.  
    * **Quantitative Data:** Specific statistics, percentages, prevalence rates, specific dosages linked to effects.  
    * **Specific Mechanisms of Action:** Explaining *how* a specific strain/ingredient/process works, particularly when linking it to a specific study or review demonstrating that mechanism.  
    * **Direct Health Claims:** Explicitly linking a strain/intervention to a *specific* health benefit or symptom modulation (Crucial for E-E-A-T and compliance).  
    * **SciCare POV Statements:** Any claim directly reflecting Seed's unique scientific stance, contrasting with common advice, or directly supporting a Dirk Gevers quote.  
    * **Authoritative Definitions/Guidelines:** Cite if referencing a *specific* definition (e.g., the official ISAPP probiotic definition) or guideline adds significant weight or clarity.  
    * **Safety/Risk Information:** Any mention of potential side effects, contraindications, or specific risks.  
    * **Novel or Potentially Controversial Information:** Claims that are not yet widely accepted or require strong backing.  
  * **Generally, do NOT cite the following (Treat as Foundational Knowledge):**  
    * **Basic Definitions:** Widely understood biological or medical terms (e.g., inflammation, gut barrier, hormone, probiotic \[unless citing the specific ISAPP definition\]) when explained simply for the audience.  
    * **Well-Established Biological Processes:** Foundational concepts described generally (e.g., basic digestion pathway, general immune response principles, common effects of aging/menopause).  
    * **Broad Introductory/Concluding/Transitional Sentences:** General statements that provide context or flow but don't make a specific, verifiable scientific claim.  
    * **Common Health/Lifestyle Advice:** Widely accepted recommendations (e.g., 'stay hydrated,' 'manage stress,' 'eat fiber') *unless* you are linking it to a *specific study result* or mechanism directly relevant to the article's core scientific argument.  
    * **Simple Descriptions:** Naming common foods (e.g., yogurt, kimchi) or symptoms (e.g., bloating, gas) without making a specific quantitative or mechanistic claim.  
* **Source Hierarchy & Rules:**  
  1. **Prioritize studies/strains and health benefits mentioned in `DS-01 Science Ref`** where relevant to the **Keyword**.  
  2. Prioritize meta-analyses and systematic reviews (last 10 years preferred). High-quality single studies are acceptable if reviews are unavailable.  
  3. **Strictly use ONLY peer-reviewed academic literature.** No blogs, non-academic websites, or general health articles (like Healthline itself) as sources.  
  4. Obtain a working `doi.org` link for every academic source used.  
  5. For each source, identify the **last name of the first author** and the **year of publication**.  
  6. **Compliance Check:** Ensure every claim aligns with the `SciCare POV` and does NOT violate `Compliance Rules`. Reject any claim conflicting with `SciCare POV`. Do not use "supplement" to refer to probiotics.  
  7. Try to limit the total number of sources to 20-23 maximum.   
* **Citation Density Guideline:** Aim for a citation density that supports authority without overburdening the text. As a rough guideline, **target approximately 1 citation per 75-100 words**, rather than a fixed total number. Adjust based on the density of key claims in each section.  
* Map the identified claims and their sources to the relevant sections of the Outline (Step 4). Prepare the Author Last Name, Year, DOI link, and full APA citation details for each claim.

**Final Output Instructions (the previous steps should just be internal reasoning steps. Output ONLY the following):**

**1\. SEO-Optimized Article (Minimum 1300 words):**

* **Tone/Voice Pre-Check:** Before writing, mentally review the `Tone Guide` and `Sample Articles` to ensure the conversational, empathetic, informative, and subtly humorous voice is top-of-mind. Actively avoid the analytical tone used during the internal thinking steps.  
* **Content:** Write the article based *only* on the internal Outline (Step 4\) and the **Key Claims** and supporting evidence identified in Step 5\. Flesh out the content with explanations, transitions, and illustrative language consistent with Seed's voice, ensuring foundational concepts are explained clearly even if not cited.  
* **Structure:**  
  * Start with an "\#\#\# Overview" section (3-5 bullet points summarizing key takeaways).  
  * Craft an **Engaging Introduction** that *immediately* answers the primary user question related to the **Keyword** (derived from Step 2\) in the first 1-2 paragraphs, then provides a compelling reason to continue reading. Emulate the style of the `Sample Articles` introductions, but ensure the core answer is upfront.  
  * Develop the body using the H2s/H3s from the internal Outline (Step 4).  
  * Integrate the SciCare contrasts and **Dirk Gevers, Ph.D.** quotes (from Step 3\) naturally where appropriate to provide unique perspectives. Ensure the reasoning behind these perspectives is supported by **cited evidence** as per Step 5\.  
  * Include a "\#\# Key Insights" section summarizing the main points near the end.  
  * Include a "\#\# Frequently Asked Questions" section answering 3-4 relevant questions concisely. **These questions should be directly based on or inspired by the "People Also Ask" questions captured in Step 1\.**  
* **\[REVISED\] Evidence Integration & Citations:**  
  * Use the evidence-backed **key claims** from Step 5 appropriately throughout the article.  
  * For every **key claim** identified in Step 5 as requiring citation according to the guidelines (specific studies, stats, mechanisms, SciCare POV, etc.), place a **hyperlinked author-date parenthetical citation** immediately following the sentence or clause making the claim.  
  * **Foundational information or generally accepted concepts (as defined in Step 5\) typically do not require citation.** Focus citations on the most crucial, specific, or unique points.  
  * The citation must be formatted as `([Author Year](DOI_URL))`.  
    * `Author` is the last name of the first author identified in Step 5\.  
    * `Year` is the year of publication identified in Step 5\.  
    * There is **no comma** between Author and Year.  
    * The **entire `(Author Year)` text block** must be hyperlinked to the source's `doi.org` URL identified in Step 5\.  
  * **Multiple Citations:** If multiple sources support the same *key claim*, list them within the *same* set of parentheses, separated by a comma and space. Each `Author Year` pair must be individually hyperlinked to its corresponding DOI. Format: `([Author1 Year1](DOI_URL1), [Author2 Year2](DOI_URL2))`  
  * **IMPORTANT** Make sure to only use **peer-reviewed academic sources**. No blogs, news articles, or general health websites.  
* **SEO:** Naturally weave in the primary **Keyword**, relevant **secondary keywords**, and semantically related terms. Optimize key sentences answering user questions for potential featured snippets.  
* **Compliance:** Strictly adhere to `Compliance Rules`. Ensure probiotics are not called "supplements." Double-check claims against approved language.  
* **Word Count:** Ensure the final article meets the 1300+ word requirement.  
* **Formatting:** Use short paragraphs, bullet points, and bolding for readability as shown in `Sample Articles` and `Tone Guide`.  
* **Special Rule:** All mentions of "DS-01®" MUST be hyperlinked to `https://seed.com/daily-synbiotic`.

**2\. Numbered Citation List:**

* Create a numbered list titled "\#\# Citations".  
* List *all* academic sources **actually cited** in the article (using the revised, more selective criteria) in **APA format**, ordered alphabetically by author last name.  
* Ensure each entry includes the working `doi.org` link gathered in Step 5 of the above thinking steps.  
* *Note: The in-text citations use the hyperlinked `(Author Year)` format, but this final list remains a standard numbered APA list for reference.*

**3\. SEO Metadata:**

* Generate the following metadata based on the drafted article:  
  * **SEO Title:** Three potential SEO titles (approx. 50-60 characters) that naturally incorporate the primary **Keyword**.  
  * **Slug:** A URL slug (lowercase, hyphen-separated) that incorporates the primary **Keyword** and optionally 1-2 relevant secondary terms (keep concise), ending with `-guide`. Example: `keyword-secondary-term-guide`  
  * **Meta Description (160 characters max):** A compelling meta description written in Seed's tone of voice, including the primary **Keyword**. \*  
  * **Article description (300 characters max):** A slightly longer description suitable for social sharing or internal use, written in Seed's tone of voice.

**4\. Suggested Internal Links:** 

* **Perform Web Search:** perform a targeted web search using relevant keywords and concepts from the article text, scoped specifically to `site:seed.com/cultured/`.  
* **Identify & Prioritize:** Identify 5-15 relevant existing articles from the search results.  
* Select the most relevant URL from the search results. **Prioritize URLs ending in `-guide` and the following list if multiple relevant options exist:**
