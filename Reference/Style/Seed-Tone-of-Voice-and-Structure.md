# **Probiotic & Gut Health Content: Tone, Voice & Structure Guide**

Based on my analysis of your articles, I've created this comprehensive guide to help recreate their distinctive style in future content.

## **TONE & VOICE**

### **Conversational & Approachable**

* Write as a knowledgeable friend speaking directly to the reader.  
* Use direct address ("you," "your") frequently to create personal connection.  
* Incorporate contractions liberally (don't, you're, we've).  
* Include occasional rhetorical questions to create a sense of dialogue and engagement.  
* Balance scientific accuracy with accessibility.  
* Use gentle self-deprecation where appropriate to make complex topics approachable.

**Example:** *"You finally remember to take your probioticsâ€”only to notice the expiration date passed weeks ago. Do they still work, or are you just swallowing expensive dust?"*

### **Empathetic & Reassuring**

* Acknowledge reader concerns and potential embarrassment about health topics.  
* Normalize common experiences ("We've all been there").  
* Use a supportive, non-judgmental tone when discussing sensitive topics.  
* Provide balanced information without causing unnecessary worry.  
* Create a sense of shared experience through relatable scenarios.

**Example:** *"If you've been quietly Googling 'do probiotics make you poop' (don't worry, your secret's safe here), you're in good company."*

### **Informative Yet Engaging**

* Present scientific information without becoming dry or technical.  
* Use analogies and metaphors to explain complex concepts.  
* Balance authoritative knowledge with humility about scientific limitations.  
* Include evidence-based information with accessible explanations.  
* Note when research is still evolving or inconclusive.  
* Transition smoothly between casual asides and substantive information.

**Example:** *"Think of probiotics as helpful allies rather than miracle workersâ€”they shouldn't replace any part of your standard prenatal care."*

### **Strategic Use of Humor**

* Incorporate occasional light humor, especially when discussing potentially embarrassing topics.  
* Humor often involves self-awareness (especially around bodily functions like poop or gas) or stems from relatable everyday scenarios (like forgetting supplements).  
* Use witty section headings or playful asides.  
* Keep humor appropriate and supportive of the educational mission.  
* Use exclamation points sparingly for enthusiasm (especially in less technical sections).

**Example:** *"Let's talk about poop! ðŸ’©"* or *"Who knew your microbiome had such refined taste?"*

### **Compliance-Focused**

* Follow FTC/FDA guidelines rigorously.  
* Avoid making medical claims or using terms like "treat," "cure," or "boost."  
* Use precise language when discussing health benefits (refer to `What we are and are not allowed to say...txt`).  
* when discussing benefits, 1. Prioritize mentioning benefits that are mentioned in the 'Ds-01 PDP' reference file, 2. use the language The 'DS-01 PDP' reference file uses (e.g. "Maintains healthy gut barrier function and integrity" or "Supports healthy gut immune function and communication between immune and intestinal cells")
* Clearly distinguish between established research and emerging science.

## **STRUCTURE & FORMATTING**

### **Consistent Article Framework**

1. **Title:** Clear, benefit-focused, often in question format.  
2. **Overview:** Bullet-point summary of key takeaways (3-5 points).  
3. **Engaging Introduction:** Personal scenario or relatable question that answers the main question quickly.  
4. **Main Content:** Organized under clear section headings.  
5. **Key Insights:** Summary of main points toward end.  
6. **FAQ Section:** 3-4 common questions (based on PAA) with concise answers, formatted as H3s.  
7. **Citations:** Numbered APA list of references.

### **Introduction Best Practices**

* Set a relatable scene or pose the reader's core question directly.  
* Answer this core question clearly and concisely within the first 1-2 paragraphs, then provide a compelling reason for the reader to continue for deeper understanding.  
* Use the introduction to set up why the reader should continue for deeper understanding.

**Example:** *"Let's talk about what happens in the bathroom is probably top of mind. Will these billions of tiny microbes send you sprinting to the toilet? Or could they be the solution to that "everything's stuck" feeling you've been battling?"* [Then answers the question directly]

### **Visual Organization**

* Use short paragraphs (1-4 sentences) for readability.  
* Create clear section headings, often as questions.  
* Use bullet points and numbered lists to break up text.  
* Bold key points and important terms within paragraphs.  
* Employ strategic italics for emphasis.  
* Include white space between sections.

**Example heading structure:**

# Main Article Title

### Overview

[Bullet points]

## First Major Section

### Sub-section

## The Key Insight

## Frequently Asked Questions

### [PAA Question 1 as H3]

### [PAA Question 2 as H3]

### [PAA Question 3 as H3]

## Citations

### **Content Distribution**

* Front-load key information in the overview and introduction.  
* Organize content from basic to more complex concepts.  
* Include practical advice and actionable information in the middle sections.  
* Provide summary and perspective toward the end ("Key Insights").  
* Answer common, relevant questions (PAA-based) in the FAQ that weren't fully addressed in the main content.

## **WRITING MECHANICS**

### **Sentence Structure**

* Vary sentence length deliberately.  
* Use short, punchy sentences for emphasis.  
* Include occasional sentence fragments for conversational feel.  
* Mix simple statements with more complex explanations.  
* Use active voice predominantly, but passive when appropriate.

### **Paragraph Development**

* Start paragraphs with a clear topic sentence.  
* Keep paragraphs focused on a single idea or concept.  
* Maintain brevity (typically 2-4 sentences).  
* Use transition phrases between paragraphs and sections.  
* End significant sections with a concluding thought or transition.

### **Scientific Communication**

* Introduce scientific terms with plain language explanations.  
* Include evidence supporting claims with appropriately formatted citations.  
* Balance technical accuracy with readability.  
* Acknowledge limitations in current research.  
* Present balanced information about benefits and potential drawbacks.  
* All claims must be evidence-based, citing strain-specific research when relevant.

**Example:** *"Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. ([1](https://doi.org/...) ) In other words, if too many of them die off before they make it to your gut, they won't be able to do what they're meant to."*

## **STYLISTIC TECHNIQUES**

### **Metaphors & Analogies**

* Use relatable comparisons to explain biological concepts.  
* Choose metaphors that clarify rather than confuse.  
* Keep analogies consistent within sections.  
* Select imagery that readers can easily visualize.

**Examples:**

* *"Think of it like adding new residents to an already busy cityâ€”there's a period of reshuffling as everyone settles in."*  
* *"Think of polyphenols as your probiotics' sophisticated dinner guestsâ€”they encourage good conversation (bacterial growth) without excessive noise (gas)."*

### **Expert Positioning**

* Present information authoritatively without being condescending.  
* Acknowledge what isn't fully known in current research.  
* Use phrases like "research suggests" rather than absolute statements when appropriate.  
* Include practical tips that demonstrate expertise.  
* Balance technical language with accessible explanations.  
* Balance informality with credibilityâ€”maintain a friendly voice while demonstrating expertise.  
* **Attribute unique perspectives strategically:** To emphasize Seed's specific viewpoint, especially when contrasting with common advice, consider attributing quotes to internal experts like 'Dirk Gevers, Ph.D.'. Use this technique for 1-3 high-impact points per article.

### **Reader Engagement Techniques**

* Ask questions throughout the text to maintain interest and create dialogue.  
* Address potential objections or concerns proactively.  
* Use direct commands in advice sections ("Look for products that...").  
* Create smooth transitions between scientific information and practical advice.  
* Include both short-term and long-term perspectives.  
* Make the reader feel understood and supported while delivering valuable information.

## **CONTENT CONSIDERATIONS**

### **Topic Approach**

* Begin with the reader's main concern or question.  
* Answer the core question quickly and directly in the introduction.  
* Explain the scientific background in accessible terms.  
* Address common misconceptions, often contrasting with Seed's POV.  
* Provide practical, actionable information.  
* Balance optimism with realistic expectations.  
* Emphasize both benefits and limitations.  
* Create a sense of shared experience through relatable examples.

### **Benefits discussion**
* when discussing benefits, 1. Prioritize mentioning benefits that are mentioned in the 'Ds-01 PDP' reference file, 2. use the language The 'DS-01 PDP' reference file uses (e.g. "Maintains healthy gut barrier function and integrity" or Supports healthy gut immune function and communication between immune and intestinal cells)

### **Strains mentioned**
* When discussing strains, prioritize mentioning the strains and their related benefits in the 'Ds-01 Science Reference File' file. 


### **SEO Optimization**

* Integrate primary and secondary keywords naturally without overuse.  
* Prioritize readability over rigid keyword placement.  
* Use SEO-friendly headings that still match the brand voice.  
* Include relevant terms in ways that flow naturally within the content.  
* **Incorporate internal links:** Where relevant and natural, link key concepts or terms to existing Seed `/cultured/` articles to enhance user experience and SEO.

### **Citation Handling**

* **Use hyperlinked numbered citations (#) immediately following significant claims.** The number must correspond to the source's position in the final numbered APA list, and the hyperlink must point to the source's DOI. (e.g., ([1](https://doi.org/...) )).  
* Provide the full numbered APA citation list with DOIs at the end of the article, ordered alphabetically by author last name.
