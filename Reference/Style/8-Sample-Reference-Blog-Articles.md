# Probiotics and Alcohol: What You Need to Know About Mixing Both

### Overview

* Alcohol disrupts your gut microbiome by reducing the good bacteria and making your digestive system more vulnerable.  
* Live probiotics can help restore healthy bacteria in your gut while promoting a stronger digestive lining.  
* Taking probiotics at the right time (several hours before or after drinking) may help them work better, as too much alcohol can interfere with their effectiveness.  
* Some probiotic strains might help counteract the negative effects of alcohol on your gut and liver.  
* For optimal gut health, drink in moderation and take clinically studied probiotics consistently.

More and more people are turning to probiotics to support their digestive health. If you’re one of them, and you also enjoy a drink now and then, you might be wondering: "Does alcohol cancel out my probiotics?"

The good news is that having a drink or two won't instantly inactivate the good bacteria you’ve ingested with your probiotic, but the bad news is that too much alcohol *can* disrupt your gut microbiome and make it harder for probiotics to do their job. 

But there’s more good news\! Early research suggests that certain bacteria strains may help support gut health in the context of alcohol consumption.[1](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cofs.2020.10.001),[5](https://doi.org/10.1002/jgh3.12528%20),[8](https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.04294-22) Let's take a closer look at the relationship between probiotics and alcohol and what a lifestyle that includes both means for your gut health.

## How Alcohol Affects Your Gut Health

Your gut is home to trillions of tiny bacteria that help with digestion, support your immune system, and contribute to your overall health. Think of it like a bustling city of ([really cool-looking\!](https://seed.com/cultured/7-mind-blowing-images-of-microbes/)) helpful microorganisms. When you drink alcohol, especially in excess, it can disrupt this delicate microbiota in several ways:

* **Kills off the good guys:** Just like how hand sanitizer kills germs, alcohol can reduce your microbial diversity by eliminating healthy bacteria in your gut while allowing harmful ones to thrive.[1](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cofs.2020.10.001),[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5513683/),[3](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.alcohol.2008.03.131) 

* **Weakens your gut's protective barrier:** Your gut has a protective lining that acts like a security fence, controlling what’s absorbed into your bloodstream. Alcohol can damage this barrier, making your intestinal walls more porous—what some refer to as a "leaky gut"—which can lead to inflammation.[9](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1415174111)

* **Creates an unhealthy environment:** Regular heavy drinking can throw off the natural balance of your gut bacteria (what experts and doctors call ["dysbiosis"](https://seed.com/cultured/top-gut-disruptors/)), making it harder for your digestive system to function properly.[5](https://doi.org/10.1002/jgh3.12528),[9](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1415174111) 

* **Causes looser stools, but not in a good way:** Have you ever noticed that your [poops hit different after a night of drinking](https://seed.com/cultured/why-does-alcohol-make-you-poop/)? That’s because your favorite adult beverage contains ethanol, which your body identifies as a toxin.[10](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhep.2013.01.035) When toxins are consumed, a healthy body tries to remove them quickly, which usually leads to diarrhea.

### What's Considered "Excessive" Drinking? 

[According to health experts](https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/about-alcohol-use/moderate-alcohol-use.html), “moderate drinking” means up to one drink per day for females and two for males—think a 5-ounce glass of wine, one 12-ounce beer, or 1.5 ounces of spirits. Anything beyond that starts to put your gut health at risk. 

## How Do Probiotics Support Gut Health?

Probiotics are live microorganisms that have [lots of health benefits](https://seed.com/cultured/five-whole-body-benefits-of-probiotics/) if you take enough of them consistently. They work by maintaining a healthy balance in your gut, which supports digestion, immune function, and even [mental well-being](https://seed.com/cultured/latest-research-on-the-gut-brain-axis/). Some of their biggest benefits include:

* **Restore microbial balance:** Certain strains of *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium* help replenish the good bacteria and suppress harmful microbes.[11](https://doi.org/10.1038/cmi.2018.7),[12](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00925)   
* **Support digestion and nutrient absorption:** Those same clinically studied strains have been shown to support gut function, particularly for issues like bloating, diarrhea, and constipation.[11](https://doi.org/10.1038/cmi.2018.7),[12](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00925)   
* **Maintain gut barrier function:** Many bacterial strains in probiotics help reinforce the gut lining and reduce inflammation.[4](https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox12040967),[5](https://doi.org/10.1002/jgh3.12528) There are too many to list all of them, but some examples of strains that help with this include *Bifidobacterium longum* SD-BB536-JP, *B. breve* SD-BR3-IT, *Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus* HRVD113-US, *B. infantis* SD-M63-JP, and *Lactiplantibacillus plantarum* SD-LP1-IT.[13](https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00446-22) 

It’s important to note that not all probiotics have the same effects. **Strain specificity is key\!** For example, *Lactobacillus rhamnosus* GG (“GG” being the strain in this case) has been studied for its potential to support gut health during times of stress, which can include chronic alcohol exposure.[4](https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox12040967),[9](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1415174111),[14](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007114512004138) 

## Do Alcohol and Probiotics Have Any Interactions?

Unlike some medications, probiotics and alcohol don’t have direct contraindications, which means that they can be taken together without major consequences.[15](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.729950) However, alcohol *can* affect how well a probiotic works in several ways:

* **Alcohol can reduce probiotic survival:** Just as alcohol can kill helpful gut bacteria, it can also lower the survival rate of the healthy bacteria in probiotic products. In other words, [alcohol damages your microbiome](https://seed.com/cultured/how-alcohol-damages-your-microbiome/).[1](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cofs.2020.10.001),[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5513683/),[3](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.alcohol.2008.03.131) 

* **Timing matters:** To get the most out of your probiotics if you drink alcohol, try taking them several hours before or after you plan on partaking. For example, if you’re going out tonight after dinner, take your probiotics some time before lunch to give yourself a buffer. This leaves plenty of time for the probiotics to “set up camp” in your gut before you crack open a cold one. 

* **Heavy drinking has a greater impact:** Moderate (not heavy) alcohol consumption is less likely to disrupt your microbiome compared to frequent or excessive drinking, which can significantly impair gut health.[3](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.alcohol.2008.03.131) 

## Can Probiotics Help Reduce Alcohol’s Negative Effects?

Some research suggests that probiotics might help protect the body from alcohol’s harmful effects, especially in the gut and liver.[6](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2024.1372755),[11](https://doi.org/10.1038/cmi.2018.7) However, the benefits depend on the specific bacterial strain, and more research is needed.

**Here’s how probiotics might help counteract effects from alcohol:**

* **Liver support:** Some probiotic strains have been explored for their role in supporting liver function in animal studies, though more research is needed in humans.[6](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2024.1372755),[8](https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.04294-22)

* **Gut health:** Alcohol can throw off the balance of good bacteria in the gut and weaken the gut lining, leading to inflammation.[3](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.alcohol.2008.03.131) Probiotics also help restore microbial balance and strengthen your gut’s barrier.[5](https://doi.org/10.1002/jgh3.12528)

* **Reducing inflammation:** Some strains of *L. rhamnosus*, *and B. lactis* have been shown to have a calming effect for gut inflammation caused by alcohol.[5](https://doi.org/10.1002/jgh3.12528),[11](https://doi.org/10.1038/cmi.2018.7),[14](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007114512004138) 

Recently, scientists tested a special probiotic in mice that helps them break down alcohol faster.[8](https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.04294-22) The treated mice sobered up more quickly and had less liver damage and inflammation. While these results are promising, this hasn’t been tested in humans yet.

For now, probiotics might offer some benefits, but they’re not going to magically reverse any damage we may get from drinking too much. The best way to avoid alcohol’s negative effects is to drink in moderation.

## Best Practices For Taking Probiotics If You Drink Alcohol

To get the most out of probiotics while still enjoying wine, beer, or liquor in moderation, consider the following:

* **Space them out by a few hours:** While there’s no fancy equation to time it perfectly, giving more time between taking probiotics and drinking alcohol increases the chances your probiotics will survive and work effectively. 

* **Modest to moderate alcohol consumption:** Occasional alcohol intake is less likely to disrupt the microbiome than frequent or excessive drinking habits.[1](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cofs.2020.10.001)   
* **Prioritize a gut-friendly diet:** A diet rich in fiber, prebiotics, and polyphenol-rich foods supports overall gut health and probiotic effectiveness.[4](https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox12040967),[7](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu11092216),[16](https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/872716)   
* **Stay hydrated:** Drinking enough water helps support digestion and reduces alcohol’s dehydrating effects.[17](https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601907),[18](https://doi.org/10.1093/alcalc/agq029)  
* **Choose a scientifically validated probiotic:** When choosing a probiotic, look for one that contains [clinically studied strains](https://seed.com/cultured/how-seed-is-fixing-probiotic-research/) at precise doses and has a delivery system that ensures survival through digestion.[7](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu11092216) Bonus points if it includes [prebiotics](https://seed.com/cultured/what-do-prebiotics-do/) to support the growth of beneficial bacteria.[16](https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/872716) 

## Everyone is Different: Understanding Individual Responses

Just like how some people get tipsy faster than others, the way our bodies handle both alcohol and probiotics varies from person to person. Your unique genetic makeup plays a role in how you process alcohol and respond to probiotics. 

Other factors like existing gut conditions, diet, stress levels, and even [where you live](https://seed.com/cultured/how-climate-changes-impact-microbes/) can influence these responses. Age and gender matter too, since our bodies process things differently as we get older, and women process alcohol differently than men.[19](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11550) 

**What does this mean for you?** While the guidelines above are helpful, it’s more important to pay attention to your body's signals and adjust accordingly. Some people might need to be extra careful with timing their probiotic intake, while others might find they're more resilient to alcohol's effects on their gut health. 

If you have specific health concerns or conditions, it's always best to consult with your healthcare provider about your individual needs. They can help you understand how alcohol and probiotics might specifically affect *you* and create a plan that works for *your* situation.

## Key Insights

Alcohol can take a toll on your gut, but a science-backed approach can help support long-term gut health. Consistently taking a clinically studied probiotic, drinking in moderation, and eating a [gut-friendly diet](https://seed.com/cultured/eating-for-your-gut/) are key steps to keeping your microbiome balanced.

However, not all probiotics are created equal. Their benefits depend on the specific strains used, so choosing a probiotic backed by clinical research ensures you're getting real, targeted support for your gut and liver.

**The bottom line?** Your gut thrives on consistency. By making mindful choices with alcohol and how you support your microbiome, you can better protect your gut health in the long run.

## FAQs

### **Can I Drink Alcohol While Taking Probiotics?**

Yes, you can drink alcohol while taking probiotics, but try to give your probiotics some time to work by taking them a few hours before or after consuming alcohol. This helps ensure they can survive and function effectively in your gut.

### **Are Probiotics Good After Drinking Alcohol?**

Probiotics may still provide benefits after drinking alcohol, especially in restoring the balance of bacteria in your gut and supporting healthy digestion. However, excessive alcohol may reduce probiotic effectiveness.

### **Does Alcohol Ruin Gut Bacteria?**

Yes, alcohol can disrupt healthy gut bacteria by reducing their populations and promoting the growth of harmful microbes. This is especially true with heavy drinking.

### **How Do I Protect My Gut When Drinking Alcohol?**

To protect your gut when drinking alcohol, take probiotics at different times than when you drink alcohol, drink in moderation, stay hydrated with plenty of water, maintain a diet that’s good for your gut, and choose a scientifically validated probiotic product with clinically studied strains.

# Probiotics During Pregnancy: Good for You and Your Baby?

### Overview

* Probiotics are generally safe during pregnancy, with no major risks identified, but it's best to consult a doctor before taking them.  
* Pregnancy can alter the vaginal microbiome. Pregnancy also tends to cause digestive issues like constipation and morning sickness. Probiotics may help restore microbial balance and relieve some of these symptoms.  
* Probiotics can support digestion and vaginal health, and help reduce risks of gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and vaginal infections.  
* Your baby may benefit from your probiotics, too\! Early research is exploring their potential for allergy prevention, skin health, and gut health, though more research is needed.  
* When choosing a probiotic, look for researched strains and check for quality, CFU/AFU count, route of administration, and storage needs.

Pregnancy is filled with excitement, questions, and perhaps a few culinary experiments that would make any self-respecting chef do a double-take. Between cravings for ice cream with pickles and tiny kicks reminding you who's *really* in charge, you might find yourself pondering the benefits of probiotics. After all, digestive discomfort is probably part of the daily routine by now.

With gut health playing a significant role in overall health and well-being, it's no surprise that pregnant people may ask, “**can probiotics be good for me *and* my baby?**”

**But what exactly should you consider when it comes to probiotics and pregnancy?** Let's explore their safety, potential benefits, and how to choose the right probiotic formulation to support the health of both you and your baby.

## Are Probiotics Safe During Pregnancy?

When you're expecting, making informed choices about your health becomes more important than ever. Naturally, you might wonder if introducing probiotics into your daily routine is safe. Probiotics (microorganisms that positively impact health when consumed at effective levels), have been the focus of numerous scientific studies.[1](https://doi.org/10.3390/diseases12120312),[2](https://doi.org/10.1163/18762891-bja00020),[3](https://doi.org/10.1111/ddg.15120),[4](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13072382) 

**The reassuring news from research is that probiotics are generally considered safe for pregnant people.** Studies haven’t identified significant adverse effects on either expectant mothers or babies.[4](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13072382),[6](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21402964/),[23](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2589933323002902) 

That said, every pregnancy is unique, and what's right for one person may not be the best for another. **Let’s learn more about what’s happening to the microbiome during pregnancy to help guide your decision.**

## The Microbiome During Pregnancy

During pregnancy, the microbes of both your gut and vagina go through changes to help protect you and your growing baby.

In the gut, microbial communities can shift to include more microbes that help extract extra energy from food to support your increased energy needs.[7](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19169961) 

As hormone levels like estrogen and progesterone rise, the vaginal microbiome typically shifts toward a more stable community dominated by *Lactobacillus* bacteria, which produce lactic acid that acidify the vagina and guard against infection.[8](https://doi.org/10.1186/2049-2618-2-4),[9](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0036466) 

Before conception, a healthy vaginal microbiome can also influence fertility by supporting cervical mucus quality and helping sperm along their journey to fertilization.[10](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0002-9378\(11\)90559-6) 

### Digestive Changes During Pregnancy

Just as your gut and vaginal microbiomes adapt during pregnancy, your digestive system also goes through noticeable shifts.[7](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19169961) As your baby grows, you might experience digestive issues that make life a bit more... interesting. 

**Common gut-related symptoms during pregnancy:**

* Bloating  
* Constipation[7](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19169961)  
* Gas  
* Heartburn (especially in the third trimester)  
* Indigestion[7](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19169961)   
* Nausea[5](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13113931)   
* Vomiting (“morning” sickness)[5](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13113931)    
* Diarrhea 

These are partly due to hormonal fluctuations that affect your digestive system. Increased progesterone relaxes the muscles in your gastrointestinal tract, which slows digestion. While this helps your body absorb more nutrients for your baby's development, it also causes those unwelcome symptoms.[11](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2019.03.075)  

### Vaginal Changes During Pregnancy

Rising levels of estrogen and progesterone promote storage of glycogen—a complex carbohydrate your body uses to store energy—in your vaginal lining.[12](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23105590) This extra glycogen provides fuel for bacteria like *Lactobacillus* to help them thrive. 

However, research shows that the vaginal microbiome can go through additional shifts throughout pregnancy.[8](https://doi.org/10.1186/2049-2618-2-4),[9](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0036466) While *Lactobacillus* species, including *L. iners* and *L. crispatus*, remain dominant, the overall diversity and richness of these microbes fluctuate, making you more susceptible to infections.[13](https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens11090980)

Elevated estrogen levels encourage the growth of yeast (*Candida albicans*), increasing the likelihood of **yeast infections**.[14](https://doi.org/10.1128/EC.5.1.180-191.2006) Changes in your bacterial landscape might also make you more prone to infections like **trichomonas vaginalis (TV)** or [**bacterial vaginosis (BV)**](https://seed.com/cultured/bacterial-vaginosis-vaginal-microbiome/), where harmful bacteria outnumber the good ones, causing discharge and odor. This could even lead to more serious complications like preterm birth.[15](https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.631972),[16](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00281-020-00817-w),[17](https://doi.org/10.17352/jgro.000051) 

**Group B Streptococcus (GBS;** which occurs in about 35% of women) is a leading cause of neonatal infections and adverse pregnancy outcomes, and can also impact a baby's gut bacteria.[13](https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens11090980) Researchers discovered that infants born to GBS-positive moms had noticeable differences in their gut microbiomes at 6 months old compared to those whose mothers were GBS-negative.[18](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-developmental-origins-of-health-and-disease/article/abs/maternal-group-b-streptococcus-and-the-infant-gut-microbiota/C5C4B986EE9532765D17DFC06FF5FAB5)

All the more reason to pay more attention to your microbiome while pregnant\! It’s not just for you, but for your baby’s health, too.

## Probiotics for Pregnancy

Selecting the right probiotic during pregnancy can feel like choosing the perfect rocking chair for the nursery—you want something that supports you now and sets the stage for comfort ahead. 

When considering probiotics, it's important to focus on those that have been specifically studied for prenatal health. For example, certain strains of *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacteria* have been associated with a balanced gut microbiome during pregnancy.[1](https://doi.org/10.3390/diseases12120312),[19](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13668-022-00429-w) 

### Potential Benefits of Taking Probiotics While Pregnant

Some studies show that the bacteria strains in probiotic products may benefit pregnant individuals by supporting digestive and vaginal health and potentially reducing the risk of certain complications like gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and infections.[7](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19169961),[16](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00281-020-00817-w),[17](https://doi.org/10.17352/jgro.000051),[20](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00203-021-02414-3) 

While probiotics show promise, research is still evolving, and their full impact on pregnancy isn’t yet fully understood. **Think of probiotics as helpful allies rather than miracle workers—they shouldn't replace any part of your standard prenatal care.** 

### Research on Pregnancy and Probiotics

There's a growing field of research investigating how probiotics could help with different aspects of pregnancy, labor, and delivery:

* **Digestive Health:** Let's be honest \- bloating, constipation, and flatulence become uninvited guests overstaying their welcome during pregnancy. Probiotics can help relieve constipation during pregnancy by improving stool frequency, consistency, and overall bowel function.[2](https://doi.org/10.1163/18762891-bja00020),[5](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13113931)

* **Vaginal Microbiome Balance:** Keeping a [balanced and diverse vaginal microbiome during pregnancy](https://seed.com/cultured/pregnancy-vaginal-microbiome/) can help prevent “dysbiosis” or an imbalance of microbes.[20](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00203-021-02414-3) A diverse vaginal microflora might even influence labor outcomes––with high-diversity vaginal microbiota and reduced *Lactobacillus* dominance often associated with increased risk of preterm birth and preterm premature rupture of membranes, or PPROM.[16](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00281-020-00817-w),[17](https://doi.org/10.17352/jgro.000051) 

* **Immune Function and Allergy Risk:** A [baby’s microbiome](https://seed.com/cultured/how-does-the-infant-microbiome-develop/) is seeded through birth, nutrition, and exposure to environmental factors during development. Although theories on the specifics of seeding vary, maternal probiotic intake may influence their baby's immune system and gut health. Exposure to a healthy microbiome helps the baby's immune system learn to respond appropriately, potentially reducing the risk of developing allergies later in life.[19](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13668-022-00429-w)  

* **Glucose Metabolism:** Some probiotic strains are being studied for their potential role in healthy glucose metabolism, which is particularly relevant for gestational diabetes.[7](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19169961)

* **Skin Health:** Researchers are exploring connections between maternal probiotic intake and infant skin health outcomes such as reducing the risk and severity of atopic dermatitis (AD) and eczema.[3](https://doi.org/10.1111/ddg.15120),[19](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13668-022-00429-w) 

* **Nausea and Vomiting:** Around [70% of pregnant women](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16566-morning-sickness-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy) experience some form of morning sickness. 1-3% get the worst of it: [hyperemesis gravidarum](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/complications/severe-vomiting/), AKA, “vomiting all day, every day while trying to grow a human.” One study found that probiotics reduced the severity of this awful side effect of pregnancy.[5](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13113931)

Remember—every pregnancy is as unique as the little person you're bringing into the world\! Before adding new probiotic formulations to your routine, chat with your healthcare provider or OB-GYN for personalized guidance, ensuring their safety and benefits for you and baby. 

### What to Look For in a Probiotic

When exploring probiotic options during pregnancy, consider the following factors to help you make an informed choice:

* **Specific Strains (with Benefits):** Look for products that clearly list the species and strains they contain, and clinical research supporting their safe and effective use during pregnancy.[23](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2589933323002902) One noteworthy strain is  *Lactobacillus rhamnosus* GG, which has been studied in pregnancy for its protective effect against metabolic disruptions.[1](https://doi.org/10.3390/diseases12120312) 

* **Active Fluorescent Units (AFUs) or Colony Forming Units (CFUs):** These measurements indicate the amount of viable bacteria in a probiotic. While CFUs are more commonly used, [AFUs offer a more precise count](https://www.eurofinsus.com/food-testing/resources/let-if-flow-probiotic-enumeration-qa/) by measuring both viable and active bacteria using a flow cytometry—a microscopic technique that uses fluorescence to detect glowing cells and spores. Reliable products should clearly list [AFU or CFU counts](https://seed.com/cultured/cfu-vs-afu-whats-the-difference-and-which-is-better/) on their packaging to ensure transparency.

* **Storage Requirements:** Some probiotics require refrigeration to maintain their potency, while others are shelf-stable. Check the storage instructions on the packaging. 

* **Delivery Method:** Probiotics come in various forms: capsules, tablets, powders, suppositories. Consider what benefits you’re hoping to achieve as well as your existing routine—which format are you most likely to take consistently? Oral probiotics have well-known effects on the gut microbiome, but may not be as effective as suppositories when it comes to the vaginal microbiome.[21](https://doi.org/10.3920/bm2022.0091) 

* **Additional Ingredients:** Pay attention to any added ingredients, such as fillers, binders, or potential allergens. Opting for products with minimal unnecessary additives can reduce the potential for adverse reactions.

Remember, it's always best to consult with your obstetrician or midwife before starting any new product during pregnancy. 

## The Key Insight

Pregnancy is an exciting time filled with important decisions: how to decorate the nursery, what to eat, and—for those reading—how to support your gut and vaginal health. Generally considered safe for pregnancy, probiotics may help keep your microbiome balanced through all the changes your body experiences.[23](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2589933323002902) But just like choosing the perfect name or the softest blanket, it’s important to [find what’s right for *you*](https://seed.com/cultured/guide-to-all-the-biotics/), so consulting with your doctor is the best way to determine if probiotics can address your individual needs. 

It may not seem like it now, but prioritizing your gut health is a simple yet meaningful way to support both you and your baby. After all, nurturing yourself is the first step in nurturing the little ones along for the ride.

## Frequently Asked Questions

# What Happens When Probiotics Expire?

### Overview

* Expiration dates on probiotic bottles provide a useful guideline, but they’re not always exact. A probiotic’s potency depends on factors like strain type, the delivery vehicle, packaging, and storage conditions, all of which influence its shelf life.  
* Certain probiotic species and strains, like *B. animalis* subsp. *lactis* and *L. rhamnosus* GG, are more resistant to environmental stresses, helping them stay viable longer.  
* The packaging of your probiotics can determine how long they last. Glass and metal containers offer more protection against heat, moisture, and oxygen compared to plastic.  
* For probiotics to remain effective, store them properly. Keep them in a cool, dry place and follow storage instructions to ensure they stay potent through their expiry date.  
* DIY tests like the "milk test" aren’t reliable for checking probiotic viability.

You finally remember to take your probiotics—only to notice the expiration date passed weeks ago. Do they still work, or are you just swallowing expensive dust?

Probiotic organisms are microscopic and placed in a hibernated dried state that need to survive until consumption to be effective. Their lifespan depends on more than just a label with a date on it, including the bacterial strains used, the delivery vehicle, packaging, and storage conditions.[1](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.989563),[2](https://doi.org/10.1208/s12249-021-02024-8) 

Then what’s the point of the expiration date on the bottle? Great question\! 

When a probiotic is tested and shown to be effective in clinical studies, it’s important that the product contains the same amount of live bacteria when you buy it—typically at least one billion. Over time, factors like heat and moisture can reduce the number of live bacteria, which is where the expiration date comes in.[1](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.989563),[3](https://doi.org/10.1093/femsmc/xtaa007)

Basically, companies add expiry labels to let consumers know how long their product will provide the intended, clinically-tested dose. 

## Why Probiotic Expiration Dates Matter

The widely accepted scientific definition of probiotics came from the World Health Organization, which states that “probiotics are **live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host,”**[4](https://isappscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/probiotic_guidelines.pdf) In other words, if too many of them die off before they make it to your gut, they won’t be able to do what they’re meant to.[3](https://doi.org/10.1093/femsmc/xtaa007)  

**Pro tip:** To ensure you're getting probiotics that maintain their potency, consider choosing products with advanced delivery technologies, like Seed’s [DS-01 Daily Synbiotic](https://seed.com/daily-synbiotic). Its ViaCap® technology is designed to protect probiotics as they travel through your digestive system, helping them reach your gut alive and effective.

### What Affects Probiotic Shelf Life? 

Several factors play into how long probiotics last, from the strains used in the ingredients to [how the product is packaged](https://seed.com/sustainability) before it’s shipped. Here’s a closer look at the key elements that influence probiotic longevity:

* **Strain resilience:** Not all probiotic strains are created equal\! Some species and strains last longer because of what they can tolerate. *Bifidobacterium animalis* subsp. *lactis* and *Lactobacillus rhamnosus* GG, for instance, are resilient to various forms of environmental and manufacturing stress, which directly impacts their survival over time.[5](https://doi.org/10.3390/foods11060785),[6](https://doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2019.1648290),[7](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2014.01.068) 

* **Formula Design:** Probiotics that are paired with [prebiotics](https://seed.com/cultured/what-do-prebiotics-do/) (nutrients that support the growth of beneficial bacteria, including probiotics) are known as synbiotics, and certain combinations can help the probiotics remain stable during storage.[1](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.989563),[8](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu9091021)  

* **Packaging:** Probiotic organisms are sensitive to heat, moisture, and oxygen—all of which can damage or reduce their effectiveness.[2](https://doi.org/10.1208/s12249-021-02024-8) To help preserve their potency, some brands use advanced delivery systems (for example, certain capsule types) and packaging. Viability tests show that glass and metal packaging have a more protective effect on probiotic survival than plastic packaging.[3](https://doi.org/10.1093/femsmc/xtaa007)  

* **Capsule Design:** The way probiotics are encapsulated makes all the difference in how well they survive during storage and on the journey through your digestive system.[9](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.3c08588),[10](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2015.05.016) The capsule can act as a protective barrier, helping the probiotics make it past stomach acids and bile salts to reach the small intestine and colon, where their real work begins. Without a strong capsule (for example, one that has a **precision-release system** to deliver strains to the lower small intestine to support systemic benefits, including digestive, heart, skin, and gut health,) the microbes could be destroyed before ever reaching their destination.

## How to Tell If Your Probiotic Has Expired

While labels with “best by” dates are helpful, they’re not the only factor to consider. Here are a few other ways to determine if your probiotics have lost their oomph:

* **Storage Conditions:** Probiotics need to be stored in a cool, dark, and dry place.[3](https://doi.org/10.1093/femsmc/xtaa007) Heat, humidity, and direct sunlight can accelerate their degradation.[2](https://doi.org/10.1208/s12249-021-02024-8),[3](https://doi.org/10.1093/femsmc/xtaa007) If you’ve been storing your probiotics improperly (like in a hot car, on a window sill, or in a humid bathroom,) you may have unknowingly decreased the amount of live bacteria in your probiotics, especially if they’re stored in a plastic container.[3](https://doi.org/10.1093/femsmc/xtaa007)  

* **Effectiveness:** If the product has expired and you notice a decline in the [positive effects you typically experience](https://seed.com/cultured/ds01-benefits-timeline/) from taking probiotics, it might be a sign that the probiotics are no longer at the appropriate viable count.[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3813376/) 

* **Physical Changes:** Look for changes in the product itself. If the capsules appear clumped together, have an unusual smell, or are damaged in any way, this could indicate that moisture or other environmental factors have compromised the probiotics.

### Do At-Home Potency Tests Work?

You may have heard of people trying a DIY method—the "milk test"—to see if their probiotics are still good. This at-home test involves mixing the probiotics-in-question with warm milk and waiting to see if it curdles. The belief is that if the milk clumps up within 24-48 hours, then it *must* mean that the probiotics are alive and active due to the fermentation.

However, [milk tests have been debunked](https://www.consumerlab.com/answers/is-the-probiotic-milk-test-effective-in-testing-the-quality-of-the-bacteria-in-probiotic-supplements-at-home/probiotic-milk-test/) as a reliable way to check if your probiotics are still good to use. While this test might reveal *some* bacterial activity, it only works for certain types of probiotics (mainly those found in yogurt), and can't tell you how many of the probiotic bacteria are actually present.[12](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2024.1327010)  For example, *Lactobacillus acidophilus* and *Bifidobacterium animalis* subsp. *lactis* do not have the ability to break down the proteins in milk.[7](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2014.01.068) So, odds are, you wouldn’t be able to detect them in a milk test, even if they’re alive and well.[12](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2024.1327010) There’s also the possibility that the milk might curdle regardless of the probiotics, which would be misleading.

The only way to *truly* know if your probiotics still work is through professional laboratory testing. Scientists would count exactly how many beneficial bacteria are alive (“probiotic enumeration”), likely using the gold standard for quantifying them: the “Plate Count (PC) method.”[1](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.989563),[13](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1304621) 

But, honestly, who has time and lab contacts for that?

Instead of trying home tests or shipping your possibly expired probiotics off to some testing facility, **just focus on storing them properly by following the package instructions and expiration dates.**[3](https://doi.org/10.1093/femsmc/xtaa007)  

## **How to Keep Your Probiotics Fresh**

While expired probiotics usually won't make you sick, they might not provide the health benefits you're looking for.[3](https://doi.org/10.1093/femsmc/xtaa007) So, keeping those microorganisms effective for as long as possible starts with finding a [high-quality product](https://seed.com/cultured/ds01-faqs-2024/) and storing it properly. 

**Here are a few science-backed tips:**

1. **Look for protective packaging:** High-quality probiotics will use delivery vehicles (for example, special capsules) and packaging that helps shield them from heat, moisture, humidity, and oxygen.[2](https://doi.org/10.1208/s12249-021-02024-8) This might include things like moisture-resistant vials or specialized capsule coatings.[9](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.3c08588),[10](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2015.05.016) 

2. **Choose stable strains:** Some probiotic strains have been rigorously tested for their ability to remain viable throughout their shelf life.[1](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.989563),[2](https://doi.org/10.1208/s12249-021-02024-8),[3](https://doi.org/10.1093/femsmc/xtaa007),[5](https://doi.org/10.3390/foods11060785),[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3747747/) For instance, most strains of *Bifidobacterium animalis* subsp. *lactis* are known for their ability to withstand certain environmental stressors, such as exposure to air.[7](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2014.01.068),[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3747747/) 

3. **Store correctly:** Probiotics should be stored in a cool, dry place (around 72°F/22°C).[2](https://doi.org/10.1208/s12249-021-02024-8) Some products are designed for room-temperature stability, while others may require refrigeration. **But don’t store them in the freezer** (or a cold car\!) Temperatures close to freezing (32°F/0°C) can cause chemical damage during freeze-thaw cycles, leading to microbial cell death.[15](https://www.internationalscholarsjournals.com/articles/effect-of-different-storage-temperatures-on-the-viabilities-change-of-probiotics-in-the-fish-feed.pdf)  

## **Key Insights**

Probiotic products do expire, but this doesn't necessarily mean they lose their value the moment the clock strikes midnight on their expiration date. A probiotic’s effectiveness depends on several things, including the strains used, the product’s formulation, and even the bottle it comes in.[3](https://doi.org/10.1093/femsmc/xtaa007),[5](https://doi.org/10.3390/foods11060785) Find the right combination of stable, clinically studied strains, protective packaging, and proper storage, and the potency of your probiotics can last for an extended period.[1](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.989563),[3](https://doi.org/10.1093/femsmc/xtaa007),[6](https://doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2019.1648290)   

It’s important to remember that longevity is not just about survival—it's about ensuring that the beneficial  bacteria are able to deliver their intended effects, whether that’s helping with digestion, microbiome diversity, general gut health; or even for supporting systems beyond the gut, such as your heart, liver, kidneys, lungs, and skin. 

To maximize the benefits, try to choose products that use proven, stable and robust strains, and store your bottle of probiotics in a cool, dark, and dry place.[3](https://doi.org/10.1093/femsmc/xtaa007),[6](https://doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2019.1648290) This way, you’ll get your money’s worth and you can be confident that your probiotics will work as intended.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### Are Expired Probiotics Harmful?

No, taking expired probiotics will not hurt you, but they do lose their efficacy over time.[3](https://doi.org/10.1093/femsmc/xtaa007) When the contents are non-viable, they are—by definition—no longer probiotics. 

### Can I Extend My Probiotic’s Shelf Life?

If you follow storage recommendations and the manufacturer has performed the appropriate tests to set up the expiration date, there is nothing else you can do to extend the shelf-life. If you *don’t* follow the recommendations, you may reduce the shelf-life. 

If you’re looking for specific product recommendations, [DS-01®](https://seed.com/daily-synbiotic), a daily synbiotic from Seed, stays potent for 18 months unopened and six months after opening. 

### How Long Do Probiotics Last?

Many probiotic brands have a shelf life between 6 months and two years, but [some can last up to four years](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/probiotic-refrigeration). Check the expiration date on the product for when the microbes will start to decrease in potency below the level in which they were clinically proven to work.[3](https://doi.org/10.1093/femsmc/xtaa007) 

### Why Do Some Probiotics Need To Be Refrigerated?

Some products have formulations that are less stable, requiring refrigeration to slow down microbial degradation.[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3813376/) Other products, like [Seed’s DS-01®](https://seed.com/daily-synbiotic), are designed for room-temperature stability, so you can store it out in the open without worrying about the contents “going bad.”

# How Probiotics Regulate Your Poop: A Comprehensive Guide

### Overview

* Probiotics can help regulate bowel movements, supporting normal pooping patterns rather than causing bathroom emergencies.  
* If constipation has you spending too much time on the toilet—or if you're reading this while your legs go numb on the toilet seat right now, we see you—probiotics may help prevent these long  bathroom visits.  
* If diarrhea has you rushing to the bathroom too often, probiotics can help support a more regular digestive rhythm by balancing your gut microbiome.  
* If starting probiotics, there may be an initial adjustment period until your pooping habits change for the better.  
* Diet choices like fiber intake and hydration can play a role in how probiotics affect your pooping schedule.

Let's talk about poop\! 💩

The question might make you blush, but let's be honest—when you're thinking about taking probiotics, what happens in the bathroom is probably top of mind. Will these billions of tiny microbes send you sprinting to the toilet? Or could they be the solution to that "everything's stuck" feeling you've been battling?

If you've been quietly Googling "do probiotics make you poop" (don't worry, your secret's safe here), you're in good company. It's one of the most common questions people have before diving into the world of gut health products.

## The Link Between Probiotics and Gut Function

Your gut houses a complex ecosystem of trillions of microorganisms that influence everything from immune function to digestive transit. Probiotics are transient, helpful bacteria that work their way through your digestive tract, interacting with your resident microbes along the way.[1](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10620-018-5139-8),[2](https://doi.org/10.3945/an.116.014407) 

Not all probiotics are the same, and your gut deserves more than just a random assortment of bacteria with fancy marketing.

### Why Strains Matter

When shopping for probiotics, think of bacterial names like a family tree (that goes *way* beyond your 23andMe results). Each probiotic has a **genus** (*Bifidobacterium*), a **species** (*lactis*), and—here's the critical part many brands conveniently skip—a **strain designation** (SD150-BE).

This strain designation is essentially your bacterial ID card—complete with address, birthday, and family history. It's the microbiological equivalent of knowing the difference between "John from Seattle who makes incredible sourdough" versus just "some guy named John."

**Why does this matter for your gut?** Because that specific strain designation is your golden ticket to finding [actual scientific research](https://seed.com/cultured/microbiome-discoveries-2024/). When a product lists **complete strain designations**, you can look up the human clinical studies that validate whether those particular microbes actually deliver on their promises or are just taking up real estate in your supplement drawer.

### What Probiotics Do in Your Gut

**These bacterial travelers can affect your bowel movements in several ways:**

* **Encouraging Gut Movement:** Probiotic strains can produce compounds called short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which give your intestines the nudge they need to move things along.[3](https://doi.org/10.5056/jnm22093),[4](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-022-02289-0) Think of SCFAs as little motivators for your gut muscles to stay on task.

* **Promoting Fiber Digestion:** Bacterial species often used as probiotic strains, such as  *Bifidobacterium lactis,* encourage the growth of other  bacteria already inside your gut that aid in breaking down fiber-rich food and bulk up stool for easier passage.[5](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.114.089151)

* **Regulating Gut Hormones:** Certain probiotics influence gastrointestinal hormones like motilin and serotonin (5-HT) which regulate gut motility and keep your digestive system on schedule.[2](https://doi.org/10.3945/an.116.014407),[6](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15040839) 

* **Supporting Gut Barrier Function:** Many probiotics help maintain the integrity of the gut lining, creating a healthy barrier between your digestive contents and the rest of your body.[7](https://doi.org/10.1016/s0016-5085\(24\)03137-8) Let’s face it, we want nutrients coming into our body, not things that might be harmful.

* **Stimulating Your Gut's Nervous System:** Yes, your gut has its own nervous system (called the enteric nervous system), and probiotics can communicate with it and make it work more effectively\![2](https://doi.org/10.3945/an.116.014407) 

Keep in mind that the effects you experience depend on your existing gut microbiome composition, your diet, lifestyle factors, and importantly, the specific bacterial strains in your probiotic.[1](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10620-018-5139-8) 

## Probiotics and Poop Frequency: What to Expect

Probiotics may help normalize bowel movements—increasing frequency for those with constipation or reducing it for those who too often have loose and watery poop. But, if you already have good poop frequency, you probably won’t feel *drastic* changes when you take probiotics to boost your health. On the other hand, if your digestive issues are serious, you should see a family doctor. 

Overall, you can think of probiotics as helpful regulators rather than disruptors.[5](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.114.089151),[8](https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000031185)

### For Constipation Relief

If you're dealing with constipation, probiotics might be the digestive equivalent of finally finding the right key for a stuck lock. **Research has shown that probiotics can:**

* Add about 1-1.3 extra successful poops per week.[5](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.114.089151),[8](https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000031185) (Granted, it’s a *small* win, but every victory counts when you're constipated\!)

* Speed up your digestive transit time by 12-15 hours.[9](https://doi.org/10.20524/aog.2017.0192) (You want your food to pass through in a timely manner rather than get stuck) 

* Help create that "ahhh, finally\!" moment by having regular toilet visits with softer, easier-to-pass stools.[1](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10620-018-5139-8) 

While probiotics won’t turn your digestive system into a Swiss train schedule overnight, they can make a noticeable difference in how [regular and comfortable](https://seed.com/cultured/how-to-poop-better/) you feel.

### For Management of loose watery stools

For those playing defense against too-frequent bathroom trips, certain probiotics may help put the brakes on things by restoring balance to the gut microbiome.[10](https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.625210) In this case, probiotic strains produce compounds that help the gut function in a way that the poop is not rushing to get out. 

### If You’re Already Regular

Lucky you\! If your bathroom routine is already running smoothly, think of probiotics as an add-on health benefit. Certain strains can support you in different ways, from helping digest food, removing unwanted compounds, increasing the number of beneficial bacteria inside you, and even having their byproducts help at sites outside the gut, like the liver, skin, and urinary tract.[24](https://doi.org/10.3920/bm2016.0222)

### Initial Adjustment Period (When Things Get… Interesting)

When you [first start taking probiotics](https://seed.com/cultured/ds01-benefits-timeline/), your gut might throw a small welcome party for these new bacterial visitors. 

**During this adjustment period, you might experience these normal symptoms:**

* [Mild gas or bloating](https://seed.com/cultured/probiotics-gas-science-solutions-guide/)

* Slight abdominal discomfort

* Changes in stool consistency [1](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10620-018-5139-8)

* Altered bowel movement frequency [9](https://doi.org/10.20524/aog.2017.0192)

Think of it as your gut microbiome's awkward "getting to know you" phase. These effects typically settle down within a few days as everyone gets comfortable with the new arrangement.

**If things are getting too wild and uncomfortable, try:**

* Starting with a lower dose

* Taking your probiotic with food

* [Trying a different product](https://seed.com/cultured/what-probiotics-should-you-take-guide/)

* Talking with your doctor

## Strain Shopping: Finding Your Perfect Bacterial Match

The world of probiotics isn't one-size-fits-all. Different bacterial strains have distinct effects on digestive function, which is why it's important to look for products with **clearly labeled strains** that have been researched for specific benefits.

### For the "Nothing's Moving" Crowd

Research has identified probiotic strains that may support regular bowel movements for those dealing with constipation.[1](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10620-018-5139-8),[8](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpgi.00327.2009),[11](https://doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2017.1412908),[12](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00394-014-0794-9),[13](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2019.02.002) 

**Examples of strains that might get things moving:**

* ***Bifidobacterium animalis*** **subsp. *lactis* HN019** has been studied for its potential to help move things along when they’re stalled.[11](https://doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2017.1412908)

* ***Lactobacillus plantarum*** **CECT 7315/7316** has been researched for its role in supporting digestive comfort and managing inflammation.[12](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00394-014-0794-9) 

* ***Bifidobacterium longum*** **BB536** has been observed for its effects on digestive transit time.[13](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2019.02.002) 

### For the "Too Much, Too Fast" Team

For those dealing with frequent watery and loose stools, there are some microbes willing to help you out.[10](https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.625210),[14](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40801-024-00424-3),[15](https://doi.org/10.3920/bm2013.0008),[16](https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.15267)

**Examples of strains that might slow things down:**

* ***Saccharomyces boulardii*** isn’t a bacteria; it’s a yeast microbe often included in probiotic products. Several *S. boulardii strains* have been extensively studied for their helpful effects on different types of diarrhea.[14](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40801-024-00424-3),[15](https://doi.org/10.3920/bm2013.0008)

* ***Lactobacillus rhamnosus*** **GG** has been researched for its potential to reduce the duration of diarrhea episodes.[16](https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.15267)

Remember that beneficial microbes are only effective at their specific, researched doses. A probiotic can contain the right strain, but make sure it has *enough of it* to replicate the benefits seen in clinical studies.

## Supporting Your Probiotics’ Success

Think of probiotics as seeds planted in a garden—they need the right environment to flourish. Your daily choices create either fertile soil or rocky ground for these beneficial bacteria to work their magic on your digestive system.

### Dietary Choices That Can Amplify Probiotic Effects

What you eat plays a crucial role in how effectively probiotics influence your bathroom habits:

* **Fiber:** Fruits, vegetables, and grains provide essential fuel for probiotics. Research shows that the right amount of dietary fiber can improve stool consistency and frequency—complementing the work of your probiotics.[9](https://doi.org/10.20524/aog.2017.0192),[17](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2018.05.012)  
* **Prebiotics:** These specialized fibers feed gut microbes. Foods like garlic, onions, bananas, asparagus, and Jerusalem artichokes have small amounts of natural prebiotics that promote the growth of beneficial bacteria in your gut[18](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu9091021). If you prefer taking precise doses (5 grams is usually recommended) there are prebiotics on the market  
* **Fermented foods:** While yogurt, kimchi, and sauerkraut are not probiotics (insert ref Marco et al.), they *do* introduce additional bacterial diversity to your gut ecosystem. This diversity supports overall microbiome resilience and function.[18](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu9091021)  
* **Adequate hydration:** Water is essential for maintaining proper stool consistency and supporting regular poops. Even mild dehydration can lead to constipation by hardening stool and slowing transit time.

### Lifestyle Factors That Shape The Gut Environment

Beyond diet, several daily habits impact your digestive function:

* **Movement encourages motility:** Regular physical activity stimulates the muscles in your digestive tract, promoting more efficient transit of waste.[19](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41575-019-0173-3) Even modest activity, like a 15-minute walk after meals, can make a noticeable difference in how regularly and comfortably you poop. 

* **Stress directly affects your gut:** The gut-brain connection is real and powerful. When stress hormones flood your system, they alter digestive function, making it more important to add probiotic benefits.[20](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cobeha.2019.01.011) 

* **Quality sleep means better gut balance:** During sleep, your body performs essential maintenance on multiple systems, including your digestive tract. Poor sleep disrupts the microbiome and can lead to both constipation and diarrhea, depending on your individual gut response.[21](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-020-00925-x) 

* **Medications can reshape your microbiome:** Drugs, including [antibiotics](https://seed.com/cultured/antibiotics-and-good-bacteria-guide/), are sometimes necessary. However, they can seriously alter gut microbe populations.[22](https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2020.572912) When medication use is unavoidable, probiotics become even more valuable for maintaining microbial balance.

## The Key Insight

So, do probiotics make you poop? The answer is a bit more nuanced than a simple yes or no. They certainly can help you poop—but not in the dramatic, emergency-run-to-the-bathroom way you might be concerned about.

Think of probiotics less as a bathroom accelerator and more as a supportive team member that helps restore normal operations in your digestive system. They need time to grow inside you and influence the many microbes that are present. So, their effects tend to be gentler and more sustainable than laxatives or anti-diarrheal medications. Meanwhile, the SCFAs they produce help with metabolism, regulating immunity, and strengthening the intestinal lining.[‌25](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-024-01728-4)

Your results will depend on your current gut situation, the specific probiotic strains you choose, and your overall diet and lifestyle. But with the right probiotic partner and a little patience, you might just find yourself enjoying the most comfortable, predictable bathroom routine you've had in years.

And honestly, in a world where so many things are uncertain, isn't it nice to have a bathroom schedule you can count on?

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How Long Does it Take for Probiotics to Make You Poop?

If you're consistent about taking your probiotics, you may notice changes in regularity within a week or more, depending on the product you’re using.[8](https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000031185) Probiotics work by supporting your gut environment, not by forcing a bowel movement. Since everyone's microbiome is unique, timing can vary from person to person.

### What's the Difference Between Probiotics and Laxatives for Constipation?

Many [laxative chemicals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537246/) typically work within 2-6 hours, depending on the specific type of laxative you take. They work by drawing water into the intestines or directly stimulating contractions.[23](https://doi.org/10.1177/17562848241249664) They provide quick relief but don't address underlying causes and may create dependency with regular use.

Probiotics take days rather than hours to work. They support digestive health by addressing potential imbalances in your gut microbiome. They don’t create dependency, but because of the multiple benefits they provide, you’ll likely want to continue taking them as part of your healthy lifestyle. 

**Probiotics offer a balanced and safe approach to supporting your body's natural processes.**[23](https://doi.org/10.1177/17562848241249664)

# Do Probiotics Cause Gas? What Science Says About This Common Side Effect

### Overview

* Gas after probiotics is a common, temporary side effect as your gut adjusts to new bacteria.

* This mild discomfort may occur as microbes become active in your digestive system.

* Prebiotics from your probiotic supplement or diet can also affect gas production.

* Gas typically decreases within a few weeks as the microbiome adjusts. If symptoms persist, it may be worth consulting a healthcare provider.

* Everyone's gut is different, so some people may experience more gas than others when starting probiotics.

Let's talk about something many of us experience but rarely discuss: gas. If you've ever taken a probiotic and noticed some extra rumbling or bloating in the hours that follow, you're not alone.

The connection between probiotics and temporary gas is common and well-documented. But before you give up on your beneficial bacteria, it's worth learning about what's actually happening in your gut when this happens.

[Gas](https://seed.com/cultured/what-your-gas-says-about-you/) could mean that probiotics are doing their job—actively supporting a healthy and diverse gut microbiota. And fortunately, there are easy ways to minimize discomfort while still getting the benefits these helpful microbes provide.

This guide explains the science behind probiotic-related gas, why it happens, and simple, effective ways to make your probiotic experience more comfortable. Because let's face it—you wanted to commit to gut health, not to becoming your home's new natural gas provider.

## The Science Behind Probiotic-Related Gas

When you add new bacterial strains to your gut via a probiotic, you're essentially welcoming billions of tiny new residents to your intestinal neighborhood. And just like any new neighbors, they need time to settle in… and this sometimes means a little noise and inconvenience. (But fortunately, these new neighbors won’t accidentally block your car in the driveway.)

### Why Gas Happens: The Microbial Moving Day

The human gut houses tens of trillions of bacterial cells. (Nearly as many as the total number of human cells in your entire body\!) This complex ecosystem is delicately balanced, so even helpful disruptions can cause temporary discomfort while your microbiome adjusts.

1. **Microbial Competition:** When new probiotic strains are introduced, they can support changes in your gut microbiota. During this adjustment period, increased fermentation of fibers and the natural turnover of microbial communities may lead to temporary gas.[1](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2024.1487641)   

2. **Fermentation Effects:** Gut bacteria ferment certain parts of your food (particularly fiber and prebiotics) in your gut, producing gases like hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide as byproducts.[2](https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00217-20) This is a natural part of how probiotics help break down fiber and support digestion.

3. **Enzymatic Differences:** Certain probiotic strains produce helpful enzymes that support the digestion of nutrients, complementing the activity of your native gut bacteria. For example, *Lactobacillus plantarum* makes β-fructosidase, (an enzyme) which helps digest prebiotics like inulin.[3](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13197-020-04244-5) *Bifidobacterium* species, like *B. lactis* HN019, are able to break down complex carbohydrates, including oligosaccharides like FOS (fructooligosaccharides), GOS (galactooligosaccharides), and XOS (xylo-oligosaccharides).[4](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2021.790561)  These digestive capabilities may temporarily increase gas production as your body adjusts to new metabolic pathways.

4. **Microbial Turnover:** As new probiotic bacteria settle in, changes in your existing gut microbiota can occur.[5](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.999001),[6](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0034938) When certain bacteria decrease, this shift can lead to the release of byproducts, sometimes causing temporary gas.[2](https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00217-20),[7](https://doi.org/10.3920/BM2020.0057)

This reshuffling is a normal part of improving your gut ecosystem, even though it might mean a temporarily gassy adjustment period. The amount of gas depends on your unique microbiome, the specific strains you're taking, and even your most recent meals.

### What Does Gas After Taking Probiotics Mean?

Gas after starting probiotics might actually be a sign that the microbes are becoming more active in your gut.[8](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu11122913) 

When bacteria get busy fermenting fiber in your intestines, they make valuable compounds like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).[1](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2024.1487641),[3](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13197-020-04244-5)  These SCFAs help strengthen your gut barrier, support immune function, and create an environment that discourages the growth of pathogenic bacteria.[1](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2024.1487641) The gas is simply a byproduct of this microbial activity.[9](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00394-017-1445-8)

Think of it as construction noise during home renovation—annoying, yes, **but a sign that changes are happening\!** Just like muscle soreness after a workout tells you your body is getting stronger, a bit of digestive gurgling can suggest your microbiome is actively acclimating.

## Factors That Influence Whether You'll Experience Gas

The good news is that not *everyone* experiences gas when taking probiotics. However, there are a couple things that may predict your likelihood of feeling bloated and gassy:

### 1\. Your Initial Gut Health

[A disrupted microbiome](https://seed.com/cultured/top-gut-disruptors/)—whether from diet, medications, stress, or underlying conditions—may be more sensitive to changes when introducing probiotics, potentially leading to temporary gas and other digestive symptoms.[8](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu11122913) It's like rearranging a messy room—there's going to be more chaos during the cleaning process.

If you have a health condition affecting the digestive system, such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), it’s important to consult a healthcare provider before starting probiotics, as individual responses can vary.[8](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu11122913)

### 2\. Dietary Patterns 

Your overall diet plays an important role in how your gut reacts to probiotics too. The types of foods you eat regularly can either support a smooth adjustment period or increase the likelihood of temporary gas.[10](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2024.04.036) 

High-fiber foods like beans, whole grains, and [certain vegetables](https://seed.com/cultured/best-vegetables-for-gut-health/) contain prebiotics that feed your gut bacteria. While this is fantastic for long-term gut health, it can also lead to increased gas as your microbiome ferments these fibers.[2](https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00217-20) (We've all experienced the aftermath of a bean burrito… right?)

On the flip side, prebiotics can come from more than just fiber. Foods rich in polyphenols––like pomegranate, green tea, and even chocolate––can help gut bacteria flourish without being fermented by them. **(Translation: less gas, bloating, and farting.)** [9](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00394-017-1445-8),[11](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2021.110189) 

Think of polyphenols as your probiotics' sophisticated dinner guests—they encourage good conversation (bacterial growth) without excessive noise (gas). Who knew your microbiome had such refined taste?

## How to Minimize Gas While Taking Probiotics

If you're experiencing the rumbles after taking your probiotic, try these science-backed strategies to make your gut's adjustment period a little less... musical:

1. **Start Low, Go Slow:** Start with a lower dose, then gradually increase to the full dose over a few days. Think of it like trying spicy food—you wouldn't immediately go for the "face-melting" hot sauce, right? While this method may keep bothersome gas in check, it should be considered a short-term approach––you may not experience the full beneficial effects if continued long-term. 

2. **Choose Strains Wisely:** If gas is persistent (we're talking "can't wear your fitted pants" persistent), consider switching to a [different probiotic formulation](https://seed.com/cultured/what-probiotics-should-you-take-guide/), as tolerance can vary based on individual factors. Look for products that list *specific* strains (those letters and numbers after the name aren't just for show—they tell you *exactly* which bacterial neighbors you're inviting over.)

3. **Choose Low-FODMAP-Friendly Prebiotics:** “FODMAP” stands for Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, And Polyols. These are carbs that can be hard for some people to digest, and may cause gas and bloating when fermented by gut bacteria.[2](https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00217-20)  [Low-FODMAP diets](https://seed.com/cultured/low-fodmap-diet/) are often recommended for people with irritable bowel syndrome, but products that contain FODMAP-friendly prebiotics may be gentler on the gut and reduce fermentation-related gas.[2](https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00217-20)

4. **Bedtime Workaround:** It’s common for people to experiment with taking their probiotics at different [times of the day](https://seed.com/cultured/best-time-to-take-probiotics-guide/) to find what works best for their body and routine. Anecdotally, some people find taking them before bed reduces their awareness of minor digestive symptoms, as these adjustments can occur while they rest.

## The Key Insight

That temporary tummy rumble after taking your probiotic isn't necessarily a cause for alarm—it could be your microbial tenants moving in, rearranging the furniture, and setting up shop in your gut neighborhood.

For many people, this brief adjustment period is manageable and worth the benefits. However, if symptoms persist or become severe, it’s important to consult a healthcare provider.

By easing in slowly, selecting science-backed strains, and giving your body time to adjust, you can minimize the gas while still reaping the rewards of a healthier, more balanced microbiome.

Think of it like any home improvement project—there might be some noise and dust during construction, but the upgraded living space is absolutely worth the temporary inconvenience.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How Can I Tell If Gas Is From Probiotics Or Something Else?

Probiotic-related gas can start shortly after taking a supplement and often improves within a few days to weeks. If your symptoms began around the same time as starting probiotics, they could be related.[10](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu11122913) 

### Can Prebiotics In My Probiotic Supplement Contribute To Gas?

Yes, prebiotics can contribute to gas for some people, particularly fibers like inulin and fructooligosaccharides (FOS).[3](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13197-020-04244-5)  These fibers feed both native bacteria and probiotics, which can increase fermentation and gas production in some cases.[2](https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00217-20),[11](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00394-017-1445-8) 

### Are There Any Probiotic Strains That Don't Cause Gas?

While individual responses vary, research suggests that certain strains, including *B. lactis* HN019, *L.* *acidophilus* NCFM, and *B. lactis* Bi-07, are generally well-tolerated and may support digestive comfort. However, individual reactions to probiotics differ, and gas production can depend on many factors, including your unique gut microbiota and diet.[4](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2021.790561),[12](https://doi.org/10.1097/MCG.0b013e31820ca4d6)  

Probiotics with a Low-FODMAP compatible prebiotic may be gentler on sensitive guts, as they are less likely to contribute to fermentation-related gas.[2](https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00217-20) 

**Remember:** While probiotics can be invaluable for your health, they're not a replacement for medical treatment. Always consult with a healthcare provider about your specific needs, especially if you have ongoing digestive concerns.

# **Probiotics While Breastfeeding: Benefits for Mom and Baby**

### **Overview**

* Probiotics support the maternal-infant microbiome relationship through multiple pathways.

* Probiotics are generally safe for most breastfeeding mothers when appropriate strains are consumed.

* Some beneficial bacteria may transfer through breast milk to support infant gut health.

**Congratulations on your new addition\! 🍼**

You made it through pregnancy, but now you’re realizing that the postpartum period comes with its fair share of, let's say, *surprises*. Between the midnight feedings and diaper blowouts, the *last* thing you need is digestive discomfort—for you or your little one. This might be why probiotics have caught your attention.

But wait—**is it safe to take probiotics while breastfeeding?** Could they actually benefit your baby? And which strains might work best for a nursing mother?

Let's check out the microscopic events happening between your gut, your breast milk, and your baby's developing digestive system—and figure out whether those probiotic supplements deserve a spot in your already-overflowing postpartum care basket.

## **Tiny Allies: Probiotics and Your Breastfeeding Journey**

Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when consumed in adequate amounts, can offer health benefits. Think of them as tiny, helpful teammates that help maintain the delicate balance of microbes in your gut.

The human body naturally hosts trillions of microorganisms, collectively known as the microbiome. These microscopic residents are responsible for things like digestion, immune function, and even mood regulation. During the transition to motherhood—especially while breastfeeding—your gut and [vaginal microbiomes undergo significant changes](https://seed.com/cultured/how-your-vaginal-microbiome-shifts-throughout-your-life/).

The postpartum period represents a unique time for the maternal microbiome. Hormonal fluctuations, physical recovery, and the demands of milk production all influence the gut environment. **(MacIntyre)**

**This is where probiotics come in\!** Supporting your own gut health during this transformative time may indirectly support your baby's developing microbiome too.

## **Liquid Gold: The Science Behind Breast Milk Microbiome**

Breast milk isn't just a food—it's a living, dynamic substance containing hundreds of bacterial species. Yes, you read that right: your breast milk naturally contains bacteria\! And yes, that's actually a good thing.

In fact, human milk contains its own special microbiome, along with **“human milk oligosaccharides” or HMOs** (complex sugars) that specifically feed probiotic bacteria. These components aren't random—they've evolved specifically to support your baby's developing gut and immune system. **(Laursen)**

Human milk is essentially nature's original **synbiotic**: it contains both probiotics—live beneficial bacteria—and prebiotics, which are specialized carbohydrates and fibers that feed these friendly microbes. **(Ames, Martin)**

This carefully calibrated microbial "starter kit" helps [establish your baby's gut microbiome](https://seed.com/cultured/how-does-the-infant-microbiome-develop/) during a critical developmental window. Research suggests that this early microbial programming (i.e., breastfeeding) may have lifelong impacts on immune function, metabolism, and even brain development. **(Laursen, Ames, Pannaraj)**

## **Got Milk? Microbes Make It Happen**

Here's where things get really interesting: your own gut microbiome influences what ends up in your breast milk. **(van den Elsen)**

Scientists have identified an **"entero-mammary pathway"** through which certain gut bacteria and their valuable byproducts can travel from a mother's digestive system to her mammary glands. **(Simpson)** This means the state of your gut health may directly impact the microbial composition of your breast milk.

Think of it like this: your gut is basically preparing a custom bacterial blend for your baby based on your own microbial makeup. Nature is pretty amazing that way, but it also means that probiotics could enhance what you're already passing on to your little one during each feeding.

## **Microscopic Inheritance: The Maternal-Infant Microbiome Link**

The connection between maternal and infant microbiomes is one of the most important ways mothers can help their babies develop a healthy immune system. **(Ames, Pannaraj)**

During and immediately after birth, babies receive their first major exposure to microbes. Breastfeeding serves as the next major avenue for vertical microbial transfer. **(Murphy, Gonia)** Through breast milk, parents share their commensal bacteria, giving babies the building blocks for a strong microbiome that can offer protection as they grow. **(Ames, Pannaraj)**

Babies born vaginally encounter different microbes than those delivered by C-section, and this difference can persist in the infant gut microbiome for months or even years. **(Korpela, Martin)**

## **Are Probiotics Safe While Breastfeeding?**

Let's address the question many nursing mothers have: Are probiotics safe to take while breastfeeding?

**The good news:** probiotics are generally considered safe for most breastfeeding mothers and their infants; however, individual effects vary. **(Sheyholislami, Fernandez)** Multiple clinical and review studies have found no adverse effects from probiotic use during lactation for either mothers or their babies. **(Sheyholislami, Simpson, Arroyo, Hurtado, Savino)**

The most commonly studied strains include various species of *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium*, which have shown excellent safety profiles. **(Laursen, Gonia)**

That said, not all probiotic strains have been explicitly studied in breastfeeding populations, and individual responses can vary. 

## **Double Benefits: Probiotics May Help You *and* Baby**

Taking probiotics while breastfeeding may offer benefits for both you and your baby. Let's explore some of the potential advantages before getting into the exact strains that can offer these advantages. 

### **Maternal Health**

For breastfeeding mothers, probiotics may help:

* **Digestive Function:** The postpartum period brings unique digestive challenges from hormonal shifts, sleep deprivation, and dietary changes, all of which could lead to [constipation](https://www.webmd.com/baby/what-to-know-about-postpartum-constipation). Probiotics may help with regular bowel function when your body needs that support most. **(Wong)**

* **Vaginal Microbiome (VMB) Balance:** Hormonal changes during the postpartum period can shift the vaginal microbiome. **(MacIntyre)** While most probiotics focus on gut health, there are also [probiotics specifically formulated for vaginal care](https://seed.com/cultured/seed-vs01-vs-other-vaginal-probiotics/). These targeted products, often in the form of suppositories or capsules, typically contain *Lactobacillus crispatus* strains to support a balanced vaginal environment. 

* **Fewer Incidents of Mastitis:** Some probiotics can help prevent the recurrence of mastitis—a painful and common infection caused by blocked ducts in the breast tissue, which often causes a fever, body aches, and lower milk production.  **(Arroyo, Hurtado)**

### **Infant Health**

**For breastfed babies, potential advantages of probiotics include:**

* **Establishing a Healthy Gut Microbiome:** A baby's gut microbiome continues to develop in the first few years of life, and exposure to friendly bacteria from breast milk can nurture this process. **(Laursen, Pannaraj)**

* **Enhancing the Natural Immune Support in Breast Milk:** While breast milk already contains immune-supporting components—like white blood cells and antibodies—certain probiotics may complement these natural defenses, providing even more support for your baby. **(Laursen, Ames)**

* **Skin Health Benefits:** Some probiotics have been researched for their ability to help prevent the development of skin conditions like eczema or **atopic dermatitis (AD)** in infants. **(Simpson, Husein)**

* **Less Fussiness Due to Colic:** Certain probiotics may relieve digestive discomfort in infants dealing with colic, a very common condition that can affect any baby. **(Berseth)**

## **Which Probiotic Strains Are Best While Breastfeeding?** 

When it comes to pregnancy, nursing, and lactation, certain probiotic strains—not just species—have been studied more extensively than others. When looking at probiotic labels, you'll see names like "*Lactobacillus* *rhamnosus* GG" that follow a scientific naming hierarchy: **Genus \> Species \> Strain**. This distinction matters because the specific strain determines the benefits you'll receive.

 Here are some strains with research backing for breastfeeding mothers:

### ***Lactobacillus*** 

Several *Lactobacillus* strains have shown promising results for breastfeeding mothers:

* ***Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus*** **GG or LGG:** Also known as “*Lactobacillus* *rhamnosus* GG,” this strain has been extensively researched for its general role in supporting gut health and immunity (for both mom and baby) **(Simpson, Berseth)**

* ***Lactobacillus reuteri*** **DSM 17938:** Specifically studied for its potential to manage symptoms of colic in babies when consumed by breastfeeding mothers **(Savino)**

* ***Lactobacillus fermentum*** **CECT5716:** May reduce inflammation in the mammary tissue, which is associated with mastitis  **(Arroyo, Hurtado)**

### ***Bifidobacterium*** 

*Bifidobacterium* strains are particularly interesting during breastfeeding because they're among the dominant bacteria in a healthy infant gut:

* ***Bifidobacterium longum*** **BB536:** This strain may support your baby’s development of a healthy gut microbiota and healthy immune response. **(Wu)** It’s also been studied for its positive effects on managing overall microbial balance in adults, which is a plus for mom\! **(Wong)**

* ***Bifidobacterium infantis*** **EVC001:** As the species name suggests, this strain is naturally found in the infant gut and has been examined for its role in immune support and digestive development. **(O’Brien)**

## **How Do Probiotics Affect Breast Milk?**

One of the most fascinating aspects of probiotic supplementation during breastfeeding is how it can influence the composition of breast milk itself.

### **Transfer of Beneficial Bacteria Through Breast Milk**

Research has shown that some amounts of probiotics from maternal supplements can make their way into breast milk. **(Gonia, Murphy)** This suggests that when mothers consume certain probiotics, helpful microbes can be transferred to their baby through breastfeeding.

For example, in one study, when breastfeeding mothers took probiotics containing strains from *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium* species, the same strains were detected in their breast milk within days. It was later found in their infants' stool samples, indicating that the bacteria successfully passed into the babies' gut. **(Murphy)** 

### **Long-term Impact on Baby’s Gut Health**

The bacteria a baby encounters as they make their grand entrance into the world (and in those early weeks and months) help establish their microbiome for life. **(O’Brien)** When mom takes probiotics during pregnancy and breastfeeding, she's not just supporting her own gut—she's setting the stage for her baby's microbial community too. 

Breastfed babies tend to host larger populations of beneficial bacteria like *Bifidobacteria* and *Lactobacillus* in their tiny guts. **(Gonia)** And these microbial helpers seem to multitask impressively, coinciding with fewer inflammation markers in breast milk and potentially supporting brain development. In fact, one study found that babies exposed to maternal probiotics through nursing demonstrated better memory abilities at 6 months. **(Gonia)**

**The key takeaway?** While scientists are still connecting all the dots, current evidence suggests that maternal probiotic use during breastfeeding might offer benefits that extend well beyond basic gut health. Talk about a gift that keeps on giving\!

## **How to Choose Quality Probiotics While Breastfeeding**

With countless probiotic products on the market, selecting the right one can feel overwhelming. Here's what to look for:

### **Key Factors in Supplement Selection**

* **Strain Specificity:** Look for products that clearly list the specific strains (not just species) of bacteria they contain. (For example, choose the product that says something like “***Bifidobacterium*** ***longum* SD-BB536-JP**” and skip the one that just says “*B. longum*.”)

* **AFU (or CFU) Count:** Check the number of [colony-forming units (CFUs) or active fluorescent units (AFUs)](https://seed.com/cultured/cfu-vs-afu-whats-the-difference-and-which-is-better/), which indicate the quantity of viable organisms. For most studied benefits, products should contain at least 1 billion units.

* **Research Backing:** Choose products with strains that have been studied specifically in breastfeeding women or for the specific benefits you're seeking. **(Fernandez)**

* **Quality Manufacturing:** Select products from [reputable companies](https://seed.com/cultured/how-seed-is-fixing-probiotic-research/) that follow good manufacturing practices and test for purity and potency. 

* **Storage Requirements:** Some probiotics require refrigeration to maintain viability, while others are shelf-stable, making them easier to keep alive through their [expiration date](https://seed.com/cultured/do-probiotics-expire-shelf-life-storage-guide/). Choose what works for your lifestyle.

### **Special Considerations for C-Section Mothers**

If your delivery was a cesarean section, you might have special considerations regarding probiotics and your baby's microbiome.

Babies born via C-section initially acquire different microbes than those born vaginally. Specifically, they miss out on exposure to the good bacteria in the birth canal and instead first encounter microbes typically found on the skin and in the hospital environment. **(Korpela)**

Some research suggests that this different microbial starting point might be associated with slightly higher risks of certain conditions, including allergies. **(Korpela)** *However*, it's important to remember that **many factors influence a child's microbiome development**, and breastfeeding is just one way to support a healthy gut, regardless of how they were brought into the world.

For parents of C-section babies, taking probiotics while you’re nursing might be particularly beneficial, as it could expose your baby to the helpful bacteria they may have missed during birth. **(Martin)** Studies suggest that certain *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium* strains may help support the development of a healthy microbiome in C-section babies when consumed by their breastfeeding mothers. **(Martin, van den Elsen, Korpela)**

## **Key Insights**

Probiotics offer a promising way to support both maternal and infant health during the breastfeeding journey. The emerging science of the maternal-infant microbiome connection highlights how closely your health is intertwined with your baby's developing systems. And how neat is it that probiotics can enhance the natural benefits of breastfeeding? The key is choosing quality products with clinically studied strains, maintaining consistency, and working with your healthcare provider to find the approach that's right for you and your baby.

As far as research goes, the microbiome is about as new as your little one, so more clinical studies are needed before we can fully understand all the mechanisms and benefits. 

Our understanding of the microbiome is still evolving, but at least one thing remains clear: the partnership between breastfeeding and beneficial bacteria represents one of nature's most sophisticated systems for nurturing human development, reconnecting with our biological heritage, and **planting the seed of optimized health for generations to come. 🌱**

## **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**

### **Can I Take Probiotics While I’m Breastfeeding?**

Yes\! Research shows that quality probiotic products are generally safe while breastfeeding. **(Sheyholislami, Fernandez)** Multiple studies have found no adverse effects for moms or babies when taking well-studied strains of *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium.* **(Berseth, Sheyholislami**, **Laursen, Gonia)**

When choosing a probiotic, look for products that clearly list specific strains (not just species) and come from reputable manufacturers with good quality standards.

### **Do Probiotics Help Prevent Mastitis?**

Some research suggests that ***Lactobacillus fermentum*** **CECT5716** can support healthy breast tissue during lactation, possibly helping to prevent recurrence of mastitis infections. **(Arroyo, Hurtado)**

If you're experiencing symptoms of mastitis (breast pain, redness, fever), contact your healthcare provider promptly, as this condition typically requires medical treatment.

### **Can Taking Probiotics While Breastfeeding Make A Baby Gassy?** 

Research suggests probiotics taken while nursing don't typically cause baby gassiness—in fact, certain strains might help reduce infant digestive discomfort related to things like colic. **(Berseth, Savino)** The *very* small amounts of beneficial bacteria that transfer through breast milk typically support your baby's developing gut rather than disrupt it. **(Gonia, Murphy)**

If your baby seems gassier after starting probiotics, consider other common causes first: your overall diet, air swallowed during feeding, or simply normal baby digestive development (they're naturally gassy creatures\!).

When in doubt, talk to your pediatrician before eliminating something that could benefit both of you.

# Feeling Sick from Probiotics? Here’s Why.

### **Overview**

* **Probiotic-induced nausea** is a common but temporary side effect as the gut adjusts to probiotics, typically resolving within a month or so.

* Factors contributing to probiotic nausea include the **initial adjustment phase**, **strain-specific reactions**, and underlying gut conditions. 

* The **gut-brain connectio**n plays a role, with changes in gut motility and microbial metabolites potentially triggering nausea signals via the vagus nerve.

* **Practical strategies**, like timing probiotics with meals and staying hydrated may help minimize discomfort.

* Probiotics may not be suitable for everyone, especially if you’re **immunocompromised** or managing specific medical conditions.

Starting a new probiotic and now your stomach is feeling a bit off? It happens. Though probiotics are known for supporting gut health, some people experience nausea or digestive discomfort when they first begin taking them. This response isn’t unusual—it reflects the complexity of the gut ecosystem and how it reacts to new microbial strains.

So, what’s really going on? Let’s unpack the science behind probiotics, why some initial discomfort can occur, and how to support your body through the adjustment period.

## Understanding Probiotics

### What Are Probiotics?

Probiotics are live microorganisms—often referred to as “beneficial bacteria”—that offer health-supporting effects when consumed in the right amounts.[1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00424/full),[2](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2023.1196625/full) While bacteria naturally occur in fermented foods like yogurt, kimchi, and sauerkraut, not all bacteria in these foods meet the scientific criteria to be considered true probiotics. Probiotics used in supplemental products are carefully selected and studied for their specific interactions with the body, especially the gut.[1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00424/full)

### The Role of Probiotics in Gut Health

Probiotics play a dynamic role in the digestive ecosystem, acting almost like maintenance crews that help keep the system running smoothly:

* **Supporting microbiome balance** after disruptions from antibiotics, stress, or dietary changes [3](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-and-infection-microbiology/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2020.572912/full) 

* **Assisting digestion** by breaking down certain food components (like carbs, proteins, and lipids) and supporting regularity [4](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/marine-science/articles/10.3389/fmars.2024.1368436/full) 

* **Interacting with the immune system**, which is closely linked to the gut, where a majority of immune cells are located [2](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2023.1196625/full),[5](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2024.1355542/full)  

* **Communicating with the brain through the brain-gut axis**, helping produce neurotransmitters like serotonin, which is involved in gut motility [6](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychiatry/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00044/full),[7](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2024.1348297/full) 

## Probiotics and Nausea: The Connection

### What Symptoms Can I Expect?

Starting probiotics can sometimes feel like a rocky introduction—especially for your gut. Side effects like nausea, as well as cramping, gas, and softer stool have been reported in human probiotic studies.[8](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/60/suppl_2/S129/379230) These reactions often reflect the gut’s natural adjustment rather than a sign of harm. 

**Common side effects of probiotics include:**

* Nausea

* Bloating

* [Gas](https://seed.com/cultured/what-your-gas-says-about-you/) (Woo\! More farting\!)

* Abdominal discomfort

* Changes in stool consistency

Think of these side effects as signs of your gut recalibrating––as new microbial strains enter your ecosystem, your body is adjusting to the presence of these newcomers.

### Why Probiotics Might Trigger Nausea

#### 1\. Initial Adjustment Phase

When you introduce probiotics, your gut’s ecosystem goes through a transition.  This is especially true if the product is a synbiotic, which contains both probiotics and prebiotics.[9](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.00217-20) 

It’s like adding new residents to an already busy city—there’s a period of reshuffling as everyone settles in. 

**During this time, typically around a month or so, the gut may experience:**

* Increased gas production as new microbes sometimes metabolize fibers and nutrients differently [9](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.00217-20) 

* Changes in gut motility, which can lead to sensations of bloating or mild nausea [10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831322006792?via%3Dihub) 

#### 2\. Underlying Gut Conditions

Pre-existing digestive imbalances can also influence how the body responds to probiotics. It is possible that those with preexisting conditions or concerns, especially related to digestive health, may experience an increased level of discomfort when introducing a new probiotic.

If you suspect an underlying gut condition, consulting with a healthcare professional before starting probiotics can help ensure you're choosing the right product and approach

#### 3\. The Gut-Brain Dialogue

The connection between the gut and the brain—known as the gut-brain axis—is a communication pathway between the gut and the brain, involving neural (e.g., the vagus nerve), hormonal, and immune signals. This pathway has been implicated in various gastrointestinal and psychological conditions, including nausea and digestive discomfort.[6](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychiatry/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00044/full) 

The vagus nerve does play a role in regulating gut function and may transmit signals related to nausea. However, nausea related to vagus nerve stimulation isn't commonly attributed to probiotic organisms themselves. Instead, changes in gut motility, metabolites, gas formation, and stool consistency related to probiotic use may precipitate feelings of nausea.[8](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/60/suppl_2/S129/379230)

## Minimizing Discomfort: A Strategic Approach

Experiencing mild nausea or digestive shifts when starting probiotics isn’t uncommon—but there are simple strategies to help your body adjust more smoothly.

### Any Tips For Probiotic Newbies?

Here are a few ways to ease into your new probiotics routine while keeping discomfort to a minimum:

1. **Time it right.**

If you experience initial nausea with your probiotics, it may be helpful to take them with a light meal. Food can protect delicate probiotic strains as they pass through the harsh conditions of the stomach and upper GI tract.[11](https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms10101948) Plus, the presence of food can ease nausea for those sensitive to changes in gut motility. But keep in mind that [consistency matters more than timing](https://seed.com/cultured/best-time-to-take-probiotics-guide/) after you’re through the initial adjustment period.

2. **Stay hydrated.**

Proper hydration supports the mucosal lining of the gut, which acts as both a barrier and an integration point for new microbes.[12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s12276-023-00960-y) A well-hydrated gut is more resilient and can help reduce discomfort during the adjustment phase.

3. **Look for a quality product.**

The probiotic market is vast, but not all products meet the same standards. Here’s what to look for when choosing a high-quality supplement:

* **AFU or CFU counts at expiration:** Ensure the product guarantees its probiotic count through the end of its shelf life—not just at the time of manufacture.  
* **Strain-specific labeling:** Look for products that actually list strains in full (e.g., “*Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus SD-GG-BE”*) rather than just the species name, as different strains can have very different effects.  
* **Transparency:** Find a company that [outlines their process and approach](https://seed.com/approach) when creating their product

## The Key Insight

Experiencing nausea when starting probiotics can feel discouraging, but it’s usually a temporary part of the adjustment process—not a sign that probiotics aren’t right for you. By approaching probiotic use mindfully—choosing high-quality products, starting with lower doses, and paying attention to strain specificity—you can help your gut adapt more smoothly.

It’s also important to remember that **your microbiome is as unique as your fingerprint.** What works seamlessly for one person might feel disruptive to another. Listening to your body and making thoughtful adjustments can go a long way in supporting your gut’s transition.

With the right approach, most people can integrate probiotics into their routine comfortably, unlocking their potential to support digestive and overall health—without the bumps along the way.

## FAQ

### Can probiotics cause nausea?

Yes, some people may experience mild nausea when starting probiotics, but not everyone\![8](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/60/suppl_2/S129/379230) For some people, this happens as their gut adjusts to the new strains but does not persist long term.

### How can I reduce nausea from probiotics?

* Take them with food, which may improve tolerance

* Make sure you use a quality product

* Ensure adequate hydration [12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s12276-023-00960-y)

If nausea persists, consulting a healthcare provider is always a good option.

### Why do my probiotics make me feel sick?

It’s common to experience mild digestive discomfort when starting probiotics as your gut adjusts to new strains of bacteria. Symptoms like bloating, gas, or changes in stool can occur during this adjustment phase.[9](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.00217-20) These usually subside within a month or so. If discomfort persists, consider consulting a healthcare provider.

# Do Antibiotics Kill Good Bacteria? How They Affect Your Gut & Health

### Overview

* Antibiotics kill both bad and good bacteria in your gut, with effects often noticeable within days of starting treatment.

* Some antibiotics are harsher than others—broad-spectrum types hit your gut bacteria the hardest.

* The effects of antibiotics can extend beyond digestive symptoms, potentially affecting your immune system, weight, and mood.

* You can help protect your gut by taking probiotics (2+ hours away from antibiotics) and eating prebiotic-rich foods, like garlic and bananas.

* Only use antibiotics when truly necessary to prevent long-term health problems and antibiotic resistance.

We've all been there. That scratchy throat turns into a full-blown infection, and soon you're leaving the doctor's office with an antibiotic prescription in hand. Problem solved, right?

*Not quite*. 

While antibiotics are remarkable at fighting harmful bacteria, they're not particularly discerning about which bacteria they kill. That prescription might cure your strep throat, but it's also waging war on the beneficial microbes living peacefully in your gut.

This disruption can sometimes lead to broader health effects, particularly with prolonged or repeated antibiotic use. Yet many of us pop these pills without considering their impact on our internal ecosystem.

Let's look at exactly what happens to your gut when antibiotics enter the scene, which medications cause the most disruption, and most importantly, what you can do to protect your microbial allies when antibiotics are necessary.

## How Antibiotics Affect Your Microbiome

Your gut is home to countless microscopic organisms. We're talking bacteria, fungi, viruses—all of them living inside you and (surprisingly) helping you thrive. These tiny inhabitants are actually pulling their weight: breaking down your food, creating nutrients you need, and keeping your immune system in fighting shape.[1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.999001/full) 

But when antibiotics come into the picture, they can throw your gut's balance off—sometimes in a big way, depending on the type and duration of treatment.

Antibiotics work by targeting specific features of bacterial cells. Some attack the cell walls, while others prevent bacteria from making vital proteins they need to survive.[2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38283841/),[3](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2106022118)  

The problem? 

While some prescriptions are targeted, others are "broad-spectrum," meaning they affect a wide range of bacteria.[4](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2779307) They can't tell the difference between the strep throat bacteria you're trying to kill and the good bacteria helping you digest last night's dinner.

So when you swallow that Z-pack pill, it travels through your digestive tract indiscriminately, disrupting established bacterial communities. Your gut microbiome can go through big changes, with some beneficial bacteria being depleted.[5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mbo3.1260) 

Antibiotic use also contributes to another issue: **antibiotic resistance**, where some of the harmful bacteria survive treatment.

Overusing antibiotics or not completing the prescribed course (we all know someone) can lead to remaining pathogens developing resistance, making future infections harder to manage. In other words, **they develop defenses against our medications.**[2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38283841/),[6](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247\(22\)00401-6),[7](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-and-infection-microbiology/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2020.572912/full)  

The truly concerning part? These bacteria aren't keeping their survival strategies to themselves. Some that develop a resistance to antibiotics can pass their **resistance genes** to other bacteria, increasing the risk of more infections that are difficult to treat.[2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38283841/)

## Understanding Gut Bacteria

### Microbial Balance

Research shows that antibiotics hit your friendly gut bacteria hard.[5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mbo3.1260),[6](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247\(22\)00401-6),[7](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-and-infection-microbiology/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2020.572912/full),[8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03986-2) Take *Bifidobacterium* for instance—a diverse genus of beneficial bacteria that help strengthen your gut lining and make short-chain fatty acids.[9](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1129904) A round of antibiotics, though, depletes this bacterial community quickly.

The same goes for bacteria that produce butyrate—a short chain fatty acid (SCFA) that feeds cells of your colon and fights inflammation.[10](https://www.cell.com/immunity/fulltext/S1074-7613\(13\)00564-5) Your gut relies on these bacteria, but antibiotics can knock their numbers way down.

These aren't just minor shifts. When your good bacteria decline, it's like losing key players from your internal defense team. This imbalance can increase the risk of digestive issues, infections, and potentially other health concerns, especially if the disruption is prolonged.

### Which Antibiotics Do the Most Damage?

Not all antibiotics mess with your gut bacteria in the same way. 

Some are like laser-guided missiles (narrow-spectrum), while others blast everything in sight (broad-spectrum).[4](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2779307)  Those broad-spectrum types—think azithromycin and amoxicillin—tend to have a greater impact on the gut microbiome because the target a wider range of both harmful *and* helpful microbes.[6](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247\(22\)00401-6),[8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03986-2)  They're hunting for the bad bugs making you sick, but your helpful gut bacteria end up as collateral damage.

There are two general mechanisms that antibiotics use to do their job: “bacteriostatic,” which inhibit bacterial growth, and “bactericidal,”which kill bacteria. Both types of antibiotics can [disrupt the gut microbiome](https://seed.com/cultured/top-gut-disruptors/), though the extent of the disruption varies by drug and dosage.[3](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2106022118)

The longer you take them, especially at higher doses, the more your gut community changes. And for some people, especially those with already fragile gut health, these changes can stick around for months after treatment ends.

## Short-Term vs. Long-Term Effects

Antibiotics start changing your gut bacteria almost immediately. Within days, your beneficial bacteria take a serious hit. While some bounce back quickly after treatment ends, others struggle to recover.[2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38283841/) **Some helpful species might vanish completely**—for example, research suggests that [*Oxalobacter formigenes*](https://www.urologytimes.com/view/o-formigenes-colonization-may-be-inhibited-antibiotics) may be particularly affected by antibiotics, and its depletion has been linked to an increased risk of kidney stones.[11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95992-7) However, its long-term recover is still being studied. 

When antibiotics disrupt your gut, the effects can ripple throughout your entire body. While these medications are essential for fighting certain infections, understanding their broader impact helps us make smarter health decisions and protect our guts during treatment.

### Digestion

The most immediate effects often show up in your digestive system. 

When good bacteria decrease, harmful organisms can flourish.[12](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19490976.2023.2186098),[13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-59399-4) Take *Clostridioides difficile* (*C. diff*) infection, or CDI—this bacterium can cause severe diarrhea and colon inflammation.[7](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-and-infection-microbiology/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2020.572912/full) Normally, your healthy gut bacteria keep *C. diff* in check, but antibiotics can weaken this natural defense.

Antibiotic use can contribute to certain digestive issues, most notably:

* **Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhea (AAD):** A well-known side effect, AAD can occur due to disruptions in the gut microbiome and, in severe cases, *C. diff* infection.[5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mbo3.1260),[13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-59399-4)

* **Gastrointestinal Discomfort, Including Bloating and Gas:** While not as consistently documented as diarrhea, some studies suggest that disruptions in gut microbiota balance may contribute to symptoms like bloating and gas, particularly when gut flora that normally aids in digestion is reduced.[7](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-and-infection-microbiology/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2020.572912/full) 

* **Changes in Nutrient Metabolism:** Antibiotics can alter the gut microbiome's metabolic activity, potentially impacting the synthesis of essential nutrients like vitamins B and K. This shift can indirectly affect nutrient absorption and metabolism.[14](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aac.01664-10) 

### System-Wide Effects 

Your gut microbiome does more than just digest food. A large portion of your immune system lives in your gut tissue, where immune cells and bacteria constantly interact.[15](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/3/886) When antibiotics disrupt this balance, it can trigger changes throughout your body.

**Research has linked antibiotic-induced disruption to:**

* Altered immune system function, potentially causing issues with allergies or autoimmune challenges [16](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2757360) 

* Oral thrush, a condition marked by white patches on the tongue and changes in taste [17](https://institutionalrepository.aah.org/jpcrr/vol6/iss4/4/) 

* [Recurrent yeast infections](https://seed.com/cultured/antibiotics-vaginal-infection/) or vulvovaginitis due to *C. albicans* overgrowth [18](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11908-019-0700-y) 

Another concerning consideration is the connection between early antibiotic use and long-term health. Some studies suggest a potential link between childhood antibiotic use and increased risk of obesity, allergies, and autoimmune disorders later in life.[16](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2757360),[19](https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi20187) (But more research is needed in this area before scientists fully understand these connections\!) 

## Protecting Your Microbiome 

Being human in the modern world means antibiotics are sometimes necessary. Even when you can't avoid them, you can still protect your gut bacteria and minimize the damage.

### Gut-Friendly Foods 

Shielding your helpful microbes during antibiotic treatment starts with smart eating. [Foods rich in prebiotics](https://seed.com/cultured/best-vegetables-for-gut-health/)—like garlic, onions, and bananas—contain specific fibers that feed your healthy gut microbes, helping them survive and multiply.[20](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/9/9/1021) 

### Probiotic Support

When antibiotics shift your microbiome, probiotics can help—[along with other ‘biotics’](https://seed.com/cultured/probiotics-vs-prebiotics-vs-postbiotics/) that support microbial health.

Taking probiotics during and after antibiotic treatment isn't just about adding more bacteria—it's about helping your microbiome get back to baseline faster. Clinical studies show that certain probiotics may reduce your risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea while helping restore beneficial bacteria.[21](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/jmm/10.1099/jmm.0.001625) 

And, in this case, timing matters\! Take probiotics **at least 2 hours before or after your antibiotic dose.** This timing gap gives the helpful microbes a better shot at surviving the antibiotic treatment.[22](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20208051/) 

Plus, if you keep taking probiotics for several weeks after finishing antibiotics, your microbiome has a better chance at recovery. Studies suggest this approach may help reduce digestive issues and support gut microbiome recovery.[13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-59399-4),[21](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/jmm/10.1099/jmm.0.001625),[22](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20208051/) 

Your gut bacteria need time to rebuild, and probiotics provide reinforcements during this vulnerable period.

## The Key Insight

Antibiotics save lives—no question about it—but they're not without consequences for your gut. From immediate digestive problems to long-term effects across your body, these medications significantly alter your internal bacterial community.

The good news? You can take practical steps to shield your gut during antibiotic treatment. While probiotics and prebiotic foods can't fully prevent changes to your gut microbiome, they may support a faster and more robust recovery.

Remember this: only take antibiotics when truly necessary, and always follow your doctor's instructions about dosage and duration. While you're on them, support your microbiome with smart diet choices and targeted supplements. This balanced approach helps you get the infection-fighting benefits you need while protecting the complex ecosystem inside you.

Your gut bacteria have been evolving alongside you for millions of years—they deserve some consideration when you're making health decisions. Give them a fighting chance, and they'll return the favor.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What Happens To Good Bacteria When You Take Antibiotics? 

Broad-spectrum antibiotics can kill or inhibit both harmful and beneficial bacteria, as they can't distinguish between the two.[4](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2779307)  Good bacteria, especially in your gut, can be reduced during antibiotic treatment. 

### How Do You Replenish Good Bacteria After Antibiotics? 

While you’re taking antibiotics, taking probiotic supplements may help maintain a healthier balance of gut bacteria and reduce the risk of digestive issues like antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Experts recommend taking probiotics at least 2 hours apart from antibiotics during treatment.[22](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20208051/) 

You can also support beneficial gut bacteria by eating prebiotic fiber-rich foods, such as garlic, onions, and other vegetables.[5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mbo3.1260),[20](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/9/9/1021) 

### Does Amoxicillin Kill Gut Bacteria? 

Yes, amoxicillin can kill gut bacteria. Amoxicillin is an antibiotic that works by inhibiting the growth of bacteria, Though it’s meant to target harmful bacteria that causes infections, it can also affect beneficial bacteria in the gut microbiome.[6](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247\(22\)00401-6),[8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03986-2)
