# Seed Health Tone Guide v2: Editorial Standards Based on Live Content Analysis

## Editor-in-Chief's Executive Summary

After comprehensive analysis of Seed Health's current blog content (14 articles, ~47,500 words), this guide codifies the actual voice, style, and editorial standards that define Seed's unique position in the health content landscape. This is not aspirationalâ€”this is how Seed actually writes.

## The Seed Voice: Empirical Definition

### Core Identity
Seed occupies a rare editorial position: **scientifically rigorous yet genuinely conversational**. The voice is that of a knowledgeable friend with a PhD who can explain complex microbiome science over coffee without making you feel stupid.

### Voice Characteristics (As Measured)

#### 1. **Controlled Informality**
- Average 2.6 contractions per article (deliberately restrained)
- Direct address ("you/your") appears ~80 times per article
- Strategic use of conversational markers without overdoing it
- Professional warmth, not forced casualness

#### 2. **Scientific Precision with Human Touch**
- 45 citations per article average (1.28 per 100 words)
- Technical terms ALWAYS explained before or immediately after introduction
- Strain-level specificity maintained throughout (genus + species + strain ID)
- Uncertainty acknowledged ("research suggests" not "research proves")

#### 3. **Strategic Personality Deployment**
- Emojis used sparingly but strategically (~4 per article)
- Most common: ðŸŒ± (growth/health), ðŸ¦  (microbes), ðŸ’¡ (insights), ðŸ’© (digestive topics)
- Parenthetical asides average 10-15 per article
- Humor reserved for potentially embarrassing topics (digestive issues, bodily functions)

## Readability Standards (Non-Negotiable)

### Sentence Architecture
- **Average length**: 11-15 words (current average: 11.4)
- **Maximum length**: 30 words (hard stop)

- **Complexity**: One main idea per sentence

### Paragraph Structure
- **Length**: 2-4 sentences typical
- **Never exceed**: 4 sentences

- **Visual breaks**: Use often to prevent wall-of-text syndrome

### Technical Language Protocol
1. **Plain language introduction** â†’ 2. **Scientific term** â†’ 3. **Reinforcement**

Example from live content:
> "Your gut has a protective lining that acts like a security fence, controlling what's absorbed into your bloodstream. Alcohol can damage this barrier, making your intestinal walls more porousâ€”what some refer to as a 'leaky gut'â€”which can lead to inflammation."

## Structural Patterns (Consistent Across All Articles)

### Article Architecture

#### Opening Formula
1. **Relatable hook** addressing reader's immediate situation
2. **Validation** of their concern/question
3. **Promise** of clear, science-based answers

Real Examples:
- "You've likely seen shelves full of 'women's probiotics,' each claiming to be the best. But sorting through the marketing noise can be frustrating."
- "So, you've committed to taking probiotics. (That's awesome, by the way!) Here you are, dutifully swallowing your daily dose..."
- "When you're on antibiotics, your gut often feels the impact."

#### The Overview Section
