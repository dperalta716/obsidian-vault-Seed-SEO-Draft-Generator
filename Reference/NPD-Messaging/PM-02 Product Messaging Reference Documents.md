## **Evergreen Product Messaging • PM-02™ Sleep \+ Restore**  {#evergreen-product-messaging-•-pm-02™-sleep-+-restore}

| PM-02™: Product Overview |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| Problem Statement  | **Quality sleep** is essential for a healthy mind and body—yet 1 in 3 Americans struggle to get enough of it. Modern life disrupts natural melatonin and cortisol patterns, making it harder to fall asleep and restore deeply. As you fall asleep, your body’s melatonin production should increase and cortisol production should go down, cueing your natural sleep cycle. But daily disruptors from **screen time** and **stress** to lifestyle habits affect your ability to unwind at the end of the day and may impact your body’s production of these key hormones. Most people turn to traditional sleep aids, which just knock you out or flood the body with amounts of melatonin that far exceeds what the brain can naturally produce, disrupting your natural rhythm and ability to rest. |
| Customer Needs | **Non-habit forming alternative to sleep aids, Safe quantities of melatonin, Feeling rested in the morning, Proactive Support, Benefits beyond sedation** |
| Product Description  | Unlike conventional sleep aids that override your system, PM-02™ is formulated with a bioidentical dose of melatonin to mirror what the body naturally produces so you can fall asleep faster, rest deeply and wake up refreshed—without the next-day haze. Powered by ViaCap®, Seed’s proprietary capsule-in-capsule technology, the outer capsule delivers bioidentical melatonin with a dual-phase release profile and clinically studied ashwagandha to promote restorative sleep. The inner capsule delivers prebiotics and GABA to the microbiome, the foundation of the gut-brain axis. Formulated for consistent use, PM-02™ balances melatonin and cortisol levels to calibrate circadian rhythms over time. |
| Product Features | 2-in-1 Formula featuring ViaCap® capsule-in-capsule technology Bioidentical melatonin released over 7 hours Non-habit forming Clinically studied ashwagandha  Adaptogenic and cellular rejuvenating formula   Prebiotics \+ a gut-brain postbiotic known as GABA for microbiome support Designed for daily \+ continuous use |
| Key Benefits | Built For Your Body’s Natural Rhythms  PM-02™ supports natural sleep patterns with a bioidentical dose of melatonin that mimics your body’s natural levels and clinically studied ashwagandha to balance cortisol levels at night. Fall Asleep Faster, With Less Disruption PM-02™ reduces sleep latency to help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep. With a dual-phase profile, the melatonin it releases in sync with your sleep cycle over 7 hours so you can wake up feeling refreshed.  2-in-1 Formula For You \+ Your Microbiome Engineered with Seed’s proprietary ViaCap® technology, the outer capsule delivers bioidentical melatonin \+ clinically studied ashwagandha to you and the inner capsule delivers prebiotics \+ postbiotics to the microbiome—the foundation of the gut-brain axis.

| Gut-Sleep Connection  | **The Sleep-Gut-Brain Axis Narrative** Emerging science reveals that the gut microbiome is inextricably linked to sleep—helping to calibrate circadian rhythms and support the production of key compounds and neurotransmitters associated with sleep, such as melatonin and GABA. Together, this gut-brain communication plays a vital role in how deeply you rest and how clearly you wake. **Key Talking Points:** • Your Gut Isn't Just For Digestion—It's Deeply Connected To Your Brain And Sleep Cycles: A balanced microbiome helps produce and regulate key compounds like serotonin, melatonin, and GABA—critical for relaxation and restful sleep. • Support Your Microbes, Support Your Sleep: The microbes in your gut help regulate the brain chemicals that control how easily you fall asleep and how deeply you rest. Nurturing your gut can mean fewer sleep disruptions and better overall rest. • Mood, Sleep, and Stress—It Starts in the Gut: Your gut and brain are in constant communication, through the gut-brain axis. A healthy gut supports balanced mood, lowered stress, and the release of natural sleep signals. • Your gut is connected to cellular repair: The gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in cellular repair and tissue regeneration through the production of metabolites, modulation of immune responses, maintenance of epithelial integrity, and systemic signaling pathways. |

| Scientific Evidence | **Melatonin** In a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating the effects of low dose melatonin in healthy young adults, it was found that taking a low dose of melatonin 2-4 hours before bed increased melatonin levels to sync with the body’s natural rhythm, supporting the transition to sleep. The results also showed that this dose of melatonin did not cause grogginess or "hangover" effects the next morning, meaning it helped with sleep without making people feel sluggish the next day. Overall, the findings confirm that taking low dose melatonin before bedtime can help people fall asleep faster and enter deeper sleep more quickly—without negative effects on morning wakefulness. **Shoden® (Ashwagandha)**  In a [double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32540634/), healthy adults with non-restorative sleep took 120 mg of Shoden once a day for 6 weeks.  The results showed that Shoden led to significant improvement in sleep efficiency, total sleep time, sleep latency, and wake after sleep onset.  In addition, Quality of Life assessment indicated significant improvement in areas related to physical, psychological, and environmental domains. |

| Scientific Evidence  | In a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32540634/) investigating the effects of Shoden® ashwagandha extract on sleep quality in healthy adults, the group using ashwagandha extract showed significantly better sleep than those taking the placebo. 72% improvement in sleep quality, compared to only 29% in the placebo group. People fell asleep faster (shorter sleep onset latency). People woke up less during the night (lower wake after sleep onset). Total sleep time increased significantly in the ashwagandha group. Sleep efficiency, which measures how well you sleep, was significantly higher in the ashwagandha group compared to placebo. Participants who took ashwagandha also reported significant improvements in physical, psychological, and environmental well-being compared to the placebo group. The greatest benefits were seen in physical and mental health, with people feeling more rested and experiencing better overall well-being. In a [small study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8843534/), using low dose melatonin, participants showed significant decrease in sleep onset latency. The melatonin dose did not cause any "hangover effects", as assessed by self-reporting, as well as mood and performance tests. |
