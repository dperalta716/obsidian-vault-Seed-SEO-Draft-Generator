Introduction 

  

* Emerging science shows that your microbiome plays a critical role in how your body metabolizes, absorbs, and utilizes nutrients. Gut bacteria help break down complex carbohydrates, unlock vitamins from food, and produce key metabolites like short-chain fatty acids that support nutrient absorption and energy production. This relationship illustrates how a healthy, balanced microbiome is essential not just for digestion, but for making nutrients bioavailable and beneficial to the rest of the body.

  

Talking Points Summary

  

* **Your Nutrients Shape Your Microbiome—and Your Microbiome Shapes Your Nutrients:** The vitamins and minerals you consume help determine which microbes thrive in your gut and how they function. In return, your gut microbes help your body unlock, absorb, and even produce key nutrients—like B vitamins, vitamin K, and minerals such as magnesium and calcium.  

* **A Healthy Gut Helps You Get More from What You Eat:** Your microbiome doesn’t just support digestion—it plays an active role in how your body absorbs and uses nutrients. By breaking down fibers into short-chain fatty acids and producing essential metabolites, your gut microbes help ensure you're actually getting the benefits of the vitamins and minerals in your diet or supplements.  

* **It’s a Two-Way Street: Nourish Your Microbes to Nourish Yourself:** Micronutrients and gut microbes depend on each other. Your microbes need nutrients to thrive, and in turn, they help support your digestion, immune system, and energy metabolism. Maintaining this mutual relationship starts with what you feed both your body and your gut.

  
  

Expanded Talking Points

  

Micronutrients and your gut microbiome work together in both directions. The vitamins and minerals you get from food or supplements can change which microbes live in your gut and how they function. In turn, your gut microbes can affect how well your body uses those nutrients—by helping your body absorb them and by making certain vitamins themselves. One important way they do this is by breaking down fiber into short-chain fatty acids, which not only help your gut absorb nutrients more effectively, but influence whole body health.

  

The micronutrient–microbiome axis is bidirectional. On one hand, microbes in the gut are consumers of micronutrients for their growth and functioning. Your nutrition and micronutrient supplementation can largely [impact](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7611859/#S2) your gut microbiome composition and function. In particular, supplementation of vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin B12, and vitamin D \- all in DM-02, contribute to changes in the composition of the gut microbiota by promoting colonization of several beneficial species from the *Bifidobacterium*, *Lactobacillus*, and *Roseburia* genera. On the other hand, your gut microbiota produces significant quantities of a wide range of vitamins, notably [vitamin K and B group](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7611859/#S2) vitamins (including B1, B2, B3, folate (B9) and B12), and facilitates the uptake and absorption of minerals such as magnesium and calcium.

## **💊 Why Should you Take a Multivitamin with Microbiome Support**

  

Your gut microbes need vitamins too—just like you do.

  

* Some of the vitamins you take in, like B vitamins, aren’t just for your body—they’re fuel for your gut microbes. When your microbes get the nutrients they need, they grow stronger, stay balanced, and do their job better.   

* And here’s the cool part: when your gut microbes are well-fed and healthy, they actually help make certain vitamins your body can’t produce on its own—like B12, folate, and vitamin K. So it’s a two-way street: you nourish your microbes, and they help nourish you back.

  

Some vitamins and minerals—or not getting enough of them—can actually change the makeup of your gut microbiome. 

  

* For example, levels of nutrients like zinc, selenium, vitamin A, and certain plant compounds like flavonoids can all shift which microbes grow or fade in your gut.  

* Your gut microbes rely on vitamins and minerals to grow and do their job. By giving them the micronutrients they need, you’re not just supporting your body—you’re shaping a healthier, more active microbiome that works better for you.  

* That’s why a multivitamin with microbiome support matters—it gives you the essential nutrients *and* supports the microbes that help you absorb and produce even more of what your body needs to thrive.

  

## **🥕 The Gut-Nutrition Connection** 

  

TL;DR: Microbes utilize micronutrients for their growth and biological functioning. Therefore, the intake of micronutrients can influence the composition and function of the gut microbiome, which then impacts you. 

  

For example, dietary supplementation with vitamins B, C, D, and E largely contributes to the microbiome [composition](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9311823/), in a positive way. These vitamins support the growth of beneficial bacteria like *Bifidobacterium*, *Lactobacillus*, and *Roseburia*, making it easier for them to thrive and settle into the lining of your gut. Minerals such as calcium, iron, zinc, magnesium, and phosphorous can also [shape](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9311823/) the human gut microbiome. 

  

Some vitamins have been shown to [beneficially modulate](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0271531721000580) the gut microbiome by:

  

* Increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria (vitamins A, B2, D, E, and beta-carotene)  

* Increasing or maintaining microbial diversity (vitamins A, B2, B3, C, K)  

* Increasing SCFA production (vitamin C)  

* Increasing the abundance of SCFA producers (vitamins B2, E) 

  

Others, such as vitamins A and D, modulate the gut immune response or barrier function, thus, indirectly influencing GI health or the microbiome.

  

On the other hand, various members of the gut microbiome can influence the bioavailability of micronutrients, by controlling their absorption and [synthesizing](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7611859/#S2) vitamins (such as vitamin K and some B vitamins).

  

Ways that the gut microbiome plays a crucial role in nutrient absorption and processing:

  

1. **Fermentation of Indigestible Carbohydrates:** Gut bacteria [ferment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32865024/) dietary fibers and certain starches from your diet, producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like acetate, propionate, and butyrate. [These](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/13/7379) [SCFAs](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32865024/) are like biochemical multitaskers. They:  

* Fuel your gut cells (especially butyrate, which feeds the lining of your colon and helps maintain a strong gut barrier)  

* Help regulate your metabolism, including how your body stores fat, balances blood sugar, and controls appetite  

* Support your immune system and reduce inflammation—not just in your gut, but across your whole body  

* Impact your brain, by helping [produce](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00018.2018) or regulate key neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, and even protecting your brain’s [barrier](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36831324/) against harmful substances

  
  

  How does a multivitamin support this? The fermentation of indigestible carbs by gut microbes is a natural way to boost nutrient absorption and metabolic efficiency. A multivitamin that understands and supports this process (through prebiotics, postbiotics, and microbial supporting compounds) can help bridge the gap between nutrient intake and nutrient utilization.

  
  

  In other words, a standard multivitamin without indigestible carbs may deliver essential nutrients, but it doesn’t support the microbial processes that help absorb and utilize those nutrients. Think of it as supplying the ingredients without fully activating the machinery that helps your body make the most of them. 

  
  

  Multivitamins don’t just provide essential nutrients—it also creates/supports the conditions for your body and microbes to use them more effectively, even if it doesn’t include traditional fiber-based prebiotics.

  
  

2. **Synthesis of Essential Vitamins:** Certain gut microbes [synthesize](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2012/872716) vitamins such as vitamin K and B vitamins (e.g., B12, B9, B6), which are absorbed by the host (you) and crucial for many metabolic processes. While lesser known, they can also synthesize [vitamin C](https://www.mucosalimmunology.org/article/S1933-0219\(22\)00392-0/fulltext).

  

3. **Enhancement of Mineral Absorption:** Our gut microbes aid in the [absorption](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35294077/) of important minerals like calcium, magnesium, and iron by influencing the gut environment and producing metabolites that increase their solubility. This matters because nutrients must be dissolved in order to be absorbed through your gut and used by your cells. These nutrients are critical for bone strength, nerve function, and oxygen transport, among other things.   

   4. Gut microbes play a crucial role in helping you [absorb](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7611859/#S2) critical [minerals](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35294077/) through various mechanisms, including modulation of [gut pH](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9311823/), production of beneficial metabolites, and direct interactions with mineral transport processes.  

  

5. **Modulation of Gut Barrier Function**: A healthy microbiome maintains the integrity of the intestinal [barrier](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5788425/#:~:text=Recent%20studies%20indicate%20that%20composition,increased%20susceptibility%20to%20certain%20diseases.), preventing pathogens and toxins from entering our system, which can otherwise impair nutrient absorption.

  

6. **Regulation of Bile Acid Metabolism:** Gut bacteria modify [bile acids](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2012/872716), which are essential for the digestion and absorption of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins.  

   7. Disruptions in the gut microbiota (aka dysbiosis) can impair these functions, potentially leading to nutrient deficiencies and associated health issues. Maintaining a balanced and diverse gut microbiome is therefore vital for optimal nutrient absorption and overall health.  

   8. And in reverse \- Bacteria in your gut [need](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6977713/) [certain](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35294077/) vitamins and minerals to grow and do their jobs—just like you do. Nutrients like vitamin A, D, B12, folate, iron, magnesium, selenium, and zinc all help shape which microbes thrive. When you're low in these nutrients, it can throw off the balance of your gut bacteria.  

      9. For example, [inadequate](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7071260/#nutrients-12-00381-t002) intake of [magnesium](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0946672X25000173?via%3Dihub), [calcium](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-021-01148-0#Abs1), and dietary fiber may lower the amount of beneficial gut bacteria. Nutrient deficiencies may also allow more harmful or pathogenic bacteria to proliferate, reducing microbial diversity (which is a crucial indicator of a healthy gut ecosystem).   

      10. Aside from [affecting the population](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7071260/#nutrients-12-00381-t002) of healthy bacteria, nutrient inadequacies can also impair the functional capabilities of the gut microbiome \- including their ability to break down fiber, make vitamins, regulate inflammation, and support  your immune system (even if the number of microbes in your gut stays the same)   

      11. For instance, deficiencies in specific vitamins, such as [B vitamins](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9227236/) and [vitamin D](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7322162/#:~:text=Vitamin%20D%20and%20its%20nuclear,inflammatory%20and%20immune%2Dmodulating%20effects.), can reduce the way gut bacteria help with metabolism and nutrient production. When your diet lacks key nutrients, your microbes can’t help you absorb or use nutrients as well—creating a cycle where both you and your gut bacteria miss out on what you need to thrive.

  

Here’s why all of this matters: 

  

* When you nourish your gut microbes, they pay you back in major ways—by enhancing nutrient absorption, producing compounds that keep your metabolism humming, calming inflammation, and even supporting your mood and brain health. The foundation of this partnership is nutrition. Without the right fuel, your microbiome—and by extension, your whole body—misses out.

  

## **🧬 Microbiome and Nutrient Absorption**

  

When gut bacteria ferment and metabolize dietary compounds, they produce a variety of [metabolites](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6795088/)—such as short- and long-chain fatty acids, lactic acid, and biogenic amines—that can influence the local gut environment, metabolism, and overall health. Some bacteria also produce vitamins as metabolic byproducts. Since humans can’t synthesize many of these essential vitamins on their own, they must rely on absorption from external sources—including microbial production in the gut. 

  

Gut microbes facilitate the digestion of complex carbohydrates from our diet that human enzymes cannot break down, such as dietary fibers and resistant starches. Through fermentation, these microbes produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which serve as energy sources and modulate our metabolism. 

  

* Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)—primarily acetate, propionate, and butyrate—are key metabolites [produced by](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2020.00025/full) our gut microbes through the fermentation of dietary fibers. In other words, when you eat fiber, your microbes produce SCFAs. These SCFAs play many important roles in the body, including helping to regulate how your body uses energy, balance blood sugar, process fats, and support your immune system:  

1. Energy Source for Colonocytes: one important SCFA, butyrate, serves as the [primary](https://www.bmj.com/content/361/bmj.k2179) energy source for [colonocytes](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/13/7379), the cells lining the colon. By fueling these cells, butyrate supports the [maintenance of](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S216183132200833X) gut barrier integrity and overall intestinal health.

  

  

2. [Metabolic](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2012/872716) Processes: SCFAs send signals to special receptors in the body that help manage how we store and use energy. For example, they can help control how much fat we break down and store, they support the pancreas in making more insulin (which helps keep blood sugar levels steady), and they influence the nervous system in ways that can affect how much energy we burn and how hungry we feel.

  

  

3. Gut-Brain Axis: SCFAs play a role in the [gut-brain axis](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00018.2018), influencing neurological functions:  

* Neurotransmitter Synthesis: SCFAs can affect the production of [neurotransmitters](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2020.00025/full) such as serotonin and dopamine, impacting mood and behavior.   

* Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity: Butyrate has been shown to [strengthen](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36831324/) the [blood-brain barrier,](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S216183132200833X?via%3Dihub) potentially protecting against neuroinflammation.

  
  

4. Inflammation: SCFAs possess [anti-inflammatory](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/13/7379) properties, not only in the gut but throughout the body.

  

Certain gut bacteria also play a crucial role in enhancing the solubility and [absorption](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35294077/) of [minerals](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b02860) like calcium and magnesium, through various mechanisms, including altering the pH of the gut environment and the production of beneficial metabolites. 

  

* For example: SCFAs produced by gut bacteria can [lower the pH](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9311823/) in the colon. This acidic environment increases the solubility of minerals, like calcium and [magnesium](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316622155379) (up to 30% of total mineral absorption), and enhances their ability to move more easily across the gut lining into the body \- facilitating their absorption. Notably, butyrate, a prominent SCFA, has been [shown to](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b02860) boost the absorption of minerals in the intestines. Your gut microbes can also produce enzymes that help [release](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7611859/#S2) minerals from foods, making them available to you.

  
  

On the other hand, some of these minerals, such as magnesium, have been [shown to](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35294077/) have a positive impact on the gut microbiome composition. 

  

## **🔄 Microbial Synthesis and Metabolism of Nutrients**

  

Our gut microbes contribute to our nutrient pool by synthesizing essential vitamins:

  

* [B Vitamins](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31649646/): Species such as *Bacteroides* and *Bifidobacterium* produce B vitamins, including B12 (cobalamin), B9 ([folate](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6795088/)), B6 (pyridoxine), and B2 (riboflavin).  

  * It is estimated that human gut microorganisms produce [40 to 65%](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4403557/) of these vitamins.

  

* Vitamin K: Certain gut bacteria [synthesize](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7928036/) vitamin K2 (menaquinone). Vitamin K, particularly in its forms produced by gut bacteria (menaquinones), plays a vital role in human health, including blood clotting, [bone](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29749440/) health, and [cardiovascular](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29749440/) health.   

  * In addition, not getting enough vitamin K from your diet alters the gut microbial community [composition](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7928036/).  

  * Note that although dietary vitamin K intake is crucial, the synthesis of vitamin K by gut bacteria provides a significant additional source, especially when dietary intake is low or inadequate. Approximately [10% to 50%](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0271531721000580) of our vitamin K requirement is made by gut bacteria.

  

\* These microbial contributions are especially significant when dietary intake is insufficient.

  

Gut microbes also help [process bile](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2012/872716) using special enzymes, and this step plays an important role in how your body handles blood sugar and cholesterol.

  

\*\*Importantly, different [types](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0271531721000580) of gut bacteria have different [genetic toolkits](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1008208) for making vitamins. Each bacterial species carries its own set of genes, and those genes determine which steps in a vitamin-making process it can perform. For example, one species might be able to make the entire vitamin B12 molecule from scratch, and another species might only be able to perform a few steps in the process and need help from other microbes to finish the job. 

  

Also, while gut bacteria need vitamins to survive and function, there are some that can’t make them on their own. Instead, they rely on other microbes in the gut that *can* produce these vitamins and [share them](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4403557/). This means your gut works like a microbial community—some bacteria make the vitamins, others use them.

  

This is [especially true](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0271531721000580) for [B vitamins](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4403557/), which are used by many gut microbes to power important reactions. Bacteria can either make these vitamins themselves, borrow vitamin parts from other bacteria, or absorb complete vitamins from their neighbors. Each species has its own way of getting what it needs.

  

The big takeaway: your gut microbes depend on each other—and on your diet—to get the vitamins they need to thrive. A diverse, well-nourished gut helps make sure the whole microbial team has access to the tools they need.

  

SO, the diversity of microbes in your gut matters—because together, they can complement each other to produce vitamins your body needs. It's like a microbial assembly line, with each species playing a specific role.

  

## **🧪 Microbial Use of Vitamins and Minerals**

  

Gut microbes not only produce but also *use* vitamins and minerals for their own metabolic processes. And microbes require different combinations of a variety of vitamins. These include fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamins A, D, E, and K, and water-soluble vitamins, such as vitamin C and the B vitamins.

  

* Vitamins: Microbes require B vitamins as coenzymes in various metabolic pathways.  

  * Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): helps your body turn food—especially carbohydrates—into energy. It does this by supporting key enzymes involved in your body’s energy-making processes. Every living organism, including bacteria, needs vitamin B1/thiamine [because](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1008208) it's [essential](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/10/6/1168) for the metabolic pathways \- the steps your cells use to release energy from the food you eat.   

    * Just like us, bacteria need energy to grow and do their jobs. To make that energy, they use a set of internal “assembly lines” or chemical processes. Vitamin B1 acts like a special helper that makes sure those energy-making processes run smoothly.

  

  

  * Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): helps your body (and your gut bacteria) [make](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/10/6/1168) important molecules (called FAD and FMN) that play a key role in turning the food you eat into energy. These molecules are especially important for helping your cells use oxygen efficiently and keep your energy levels steady. Without vitamin B2, bacteria can't make these molecules, which help them generate fuel to stay alive and function, and their energy-making process would stall.  

  * Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine): helps your body use protein from the food you eat. It [supports](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/10/6/1168) important chemical reactions that break down and build up amino acids—the building blocks of protein—so your body can use them to make energy, repair tissues, and carry out everyday functions.  

    * Bacteria use vitamin B6 to carry out some of their most important jobs, including breaking down and using proteins and making neurotransmitters. 

  

  

  * Vitamin B9 (Folate): Folate is essential for [several](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6795088/) metabolic processes including making and repairing [DNA](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/10/6/1168), making certain proteins and keeping your cells (including bacteria) growing and working properly. Given the important role of folates in cell maintenance, deficiency in folate has been linked to several health disorders, including coronary heart disease, osteoporosis, Alzheimer’s disease, and colorectal cancer.  

    * Our gut bacteria use folate to build and repair their DNA. Every time bacteria divide (which they do often), they need folate to copy their DNA properly. Without enough folate, it’s like trying to build a house without enough blueprints or nails—things fall apart quickly.  

    * Folate is not only critical for your gut microbes, but [gut health too](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/10/6/1168). When you don’t get enough folate, the lining of the small intestine changes shape. The tiny finger-like structures that absorb nutrients (villi) shrink, while the pockets where new cells grow (crypts) get deeper. These changes disrupt how cells grow and mature, leading to a higher risk of abnormal growth—and even cancer—in the gut. A diet low in folate may also reduce the diversity of the gut microbiome.

  

  

  * Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin): helps your body make and use important molecules needed for energy and cell repair. It also plays a role in keeping your blood and nerves healthy by supporting processes that help build proteins and break down certain types of fats.  

    * Vitamin B12 helps bacteria complete important tasks, [such as](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/10/6/1168) making energy and copy their DNA. Without B12, those tasks slow down or stop, and the bacteria can’t work properly or reproduce. In fact, more than [80%](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/10/6/1168) of gut bacteria require B12 for their metabolic reactions. 

  
  

* Minerals: Gut microbes also absorb and use minerals such as magnesium, calcium, and zinc for their own growth and metabolic functions. For example:  

  * Magnesium plays a [key role in many](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8065437/#:~:text=Mg2+%20is%20involved%20in,and%20RNA%20stability%2C%20and%20cell) [important](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4586582/) enzymatic activities and cellular processes, like helping cells (including bacterial) work properly and supporting the building and repair of DNA. It has also been shown to [affect](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/12/4188) the [health](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0946672X25000173#:~:text=This%20study%20concludes%20that%20a,preventing%20chronic%20diseases%20associated%20with) and  [balance](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9311823/) of gut [microbes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25773775/)—helping certain beneficial bacteria grow—which can, in turn, indirectly improve how well your body absorbs and uses minerals.  

  * Calcium is pivotal for microbial [cell wall](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4299761/) integrity and [signalling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0966842X23001907#:~:text=Calcium%20signaling%20plays%20a%20role,those%20relevant%20to%20biofilm%20development.). Some types of gut bacteria can also make calcium easier to [absorb](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9881461/) in the gut, which helps both the microbes and your body get the most out of this important   

  * Zinc: Required for the structural integrity of proteins and is needed for enzymes to do their jobs in the body, and in bacteria.  Just like humans, gut bacteria [need zinc](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7931793/) to thrive. Zinc is a cofactor (helper) for many bacterial enzymes, assisting in essential tasks such as building proteins and copying DNA. Without enough zinc, these bacteria can't function properly, leading to reduced growth and activity. Zinc also [contributes to](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/23/13074) the integrity of the gut barrier, and deficiency can also decrease the [diversity](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-3900/61/1/16) of gut bacteria, leading to dysbiosis. This imbalance can weaken the gut barrier, making it more permeable and potentially leading to inflammation and other digestive issues .

  

* Other Compounds:   

  * CoQ10: Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) can influence the gut microbiome, particularly through its [antioxidant](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2018.00044/full#F1) properties and effects on microbial [composition](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2025.1504831/full) and [metabolism](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/16/5/686). It can fuel the mitochondria, reduce oxidative stress and contribute to overall cellular function and longevity in the colon. It may also [support](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2025.1504831/full) an increase in beneficial bacteria (such as *Lactobacillus* and *Limosilactobacillus)* and a decrease in potentially harmful species. CoQ10 may also increase the levels of [SCFAs](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/16/5/686) made by gut bacteria (by up to 126% in the case of butyrate).   

  * PQQ: PQQ's antioxidant capabilities may also help reduce [oxidative stress](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0531556515001047?via%3Dihub) in the GI tract, potentially supporting overall gut health. PQQ may also help your gut cells make more energy by boosting the health and number of their [mitochondria](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19861415/). This extra energy helps keep the gut lining strong and working properly, which is important for digestion and protecting your body from harmful substances. Certain bacteria can also use PQQ-dependent enzymes, so PQQ might influence the activity of these microbes (though more research is needed to clarify this).  

  * Spermidine: [Spermidine](https://academic.oup.com/ecco-jcc/article/17/9/1489/7095597) supports the health of the cells [lining the gut](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33151120/), enhancing the gut barrier function. Spermidine may also [influence](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33151120/) the gut microbiome, promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria while inhibiting harmful ones. It has also been [shown to](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891584920313034?via%3Dihub) have anti-[inflammatory](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29371440/) properties, contributing to reduced intestinal inflammation.  

    Delivering these compounds directly to the colon may concentrate their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects where they are most needed, potentially benefiting colon health. Direct exposure of gut microbes to these compounds could also influence microbial composition and activity, and concentrate the beneficial effects on the gut lining (in the case of spermidine). A colon-targeted delivery system helps protect these compounds from degradation in the upper GI tract, ensuring more of the compound reaches the colon intact.

  

## **🌎 The Connection between Immune Function & Healthy Aging**

  

1. **Summary**  

   2. A healthy, diverse gut microbiome, supported by the right nutrients, helps:  

      3. Keep inflammation in check  

      4. Strengthen your immune defenses  

      5. Slow down some of the effects of aging  

   6. Supporting your gut—through the intake of key nutrients—is one of the most powerful things you can do for long-term health and resilience as you age.  

   7. Taking care of your gut microbes isn’t just about digestion—it’s about long-term immunity and aging well. By supporting your microbiome through smart nutrition, fiber, and other healthy habits, you help protect your immune system and reduce inflammation as you age.  

   8. Maintaining a healthy and diverse gut microbiota is crucial for robust immune function and healthy aging. By supporting our microbiome, we can help mitigate age-related immune decline and promote healthy aging and longevity.  

9. **Deep Science**  

   10. Your gut microbes do a lot more than help with digestion. They actually produce key vitamins like the B vitamins and vitamin K, and help your body process important minerals like iron and magnesium. These nutrients are essential for keeping your immune system strong and your metabolism running smoothly. When you don’t get enough of them—either from your diet/supplements or because your gut microbes aren’t producing them well—your immune system can weaken, and your body may start to age faster.  

   11. Your gut microbes play a [key role](https://immunityageing.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12979-020-00213-w) in keeping your immune system balanced and resilient. Studies in animals raised without any gut bacteria have shown us that their immune systems don’t develop properly, which shows just how important these microbes are/this connection is. Certain helpful bacteria actually train your immune system—teaching it when to fight off threats and when to stay calm—by helping to produce important immune cells that protect you without overreacting.  

   12. As we get older, keeping your gut microbiome healthy becomes more important than ever—especially for your immune system and overall well-being. As we age, chronic, low-grade inflammation becomes more common. This kind of ongoing inflammation damages cells and tissues over time and is linked to many age-related health issues. But your gut microbiome can help regulate that inflammation. Certain beneficial bacteria (like *Bifidobacterium longum* and *Bifidobacterium infantis*) actually produce compounds that calm inflammation and support immune balance—both short-term and long-term.  

   13. When your gut microbes are in balance, they help keep inflammation in check, support your immune defenses, and maintain the lining of your gut. But as we [age](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S207905702560003X), this balance often [shifts](https://immunityageing.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12979-020-00213-w)—resulting in dysbiosis. That means there are fewer helpful microbes and more harmful, inflammatory ones. Dysbiosis can trigger a chain of pathological and inflammatory events, for example, alteration of levels of microbiota-affected metabolites, impaired function and integrity of the GI tract, and increased gut leakiness. All of these enhance systemic inflammation, which when [associated](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S207905702560003X) with aging is termed [inflammaging](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10911963/), and result in consequent aging-associated pathologies.  

      14. This [imbalance](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-021-00126-8) can set off a chain reaction:  

         * The gut lining becomes weaker and more “permeable”, allowing harmful substances to escape into the bloodstream.  

         * The body starts producing more inflammation—not just in the gut, but throughout the entire body.  

         * Over time, this low-grade, chronic inflammation—often called “inflammaging”—can [contribute](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-021-00126-8) to health problems linked to aging, like joint issues, heart disease, or cognitive decline.

  

## **🧓 Microbiome and Healthy Aging**

  

Aging is [associated](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-021-00126-8) with alterations in gut microbiota composition, often leading to reduced microbial diversity and an imbalance favoring pro-inflammatory species. This dysbiosis can compromise gut barrier integrity, facilitating systemic inflammation—a phenomenon termed "inflammaging." Such chronic low-grade inflammation is linked to various age-related diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and metabolic syndromes. 

  

Moreover, the gut microbiota influences mitochondrial function and oxidative stress responses, both critical factors in the aging process. By modulating these pathways, a balanced microbiota can contribute to improved cellular function and longevity.

  

1. The gut microbiota's ability to synthesize essential vitamins (e.g., B-group vitamins and vitamin K) and metabolize minerals affects both immune competence and metabolic health. Deficiencies in these micronutrients can impair immune responses and accelerate aging processes.  

2. Persistent inflammation [contributes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-021-00126-8) to premature aging by accelerating damage to cells, tissues, and the immune system. The gut microbiome can regulate inflammation by producing beneficial metabolites that mediate inflammatory responses. Therefore, a resilient, diverse microbiome promotes immune balance and systemic health.   

3. A healthy microbiome can support anti-inflammatory bacterial strains (like *Bifidobacterium longum* and *Bifidobacterium infantis*), supporting both the reduction of both acute inflammation and long-term inflammatory balance, mitigating aging’s effects.  

4. In summary, maintaining a healthy and diverse gut microbiota is crucial for robust immune function and healthy aging. By supporting our microbiome, we can help mitigate age-related immune decline and promote healthy aging and longevity.

  

## **🍴Nutrient Deficiencies And Inadequacies**

  

Even among health-conscious populations, micronutrient deficiencies are common. People are overfed but undernourished due to nutrient-poor diets.

  

1. A considerable percentage of the U.S. population [falls short](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21865568/) of the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) for vitamins A, C, D, and E (with deficiencies noted at 34%, 25%, 70%, and 60% respectively). Additionally, magnesium intake was inadequate for about 45% of the population. Calcium intake was also a concern for 38% of individuals.  

2. Globally, more than [two billion](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10969708/) people are suffering from micronutrient insufficiency, especially iodine, iron, folate, vitamin A, and zinc

  

These deficiencies are linked not just to poor dietary choices and in some cases food insecurity, but also to reduced nutrient availability in food due to soil depletion and changes in farming practices. Novel strains/varieties of crops have been introduced over the decades that produce additional yield, growth rate, and pest and disease resistance, but result in lower levels of nutrients. Even whole foods aren't immune to nutritional dilution.

  

1. Nutritional dilution has [accelerated](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10969708/) dramatically in more recent years: There was only a \~20% loss over 70–80 years, but up to 80% loss in just the past 30–40 years.

  

## **💊 Connection to DM-02TM**

  

The ingredients in DM are formulated to support the production of key SCFAs, the metabolism of flavonoids with potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and help reverse gut dysbiosis. 

  

* DM is designed to fuel the kind of gut activity that supports your entire body—from reducing inflammation to promoting resilience as you age. Its ingredients help your microbes produce beneficial compounds like SCFAs, process flavonoids that fight inflammation and oxidative stress, and rebalance your gut microbiome.  

* The ingredients in DM are crafted to support your body’s natural ability to create short-chain fatty acids—powerful microbial compounds that help regulate immunity, metabolism, and even brain health. At the same time, DM helps your gut microbes fight inflammation and restore balance to your microbiome.  

* DM supports a healthier gut ecosystem as you age—helping to reduce the chronic inflammation and microbial imbalances that tend to creep in over time. It’s formulated to promote the production of SCFAs and the breakdown of antioxidant-rich flavonoids, keeping your gut—and the rest of your body—strong and resilient.  

* The ingredients in DM-02 are designed to work together to help your body get more benefit from flavonoids. They do this by helping your body’s natural enzymes break flavonoids down more effectively, supporting a healthy balance of gut bacteria, which also helps process flavonoids, and making flavonoids easier for your body to absorb and use.  Together, this means your body may get more of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits that flavonoids can offer. In other words, DM can help your body:  

1. Break down and activate flavonoids you eat more efficiently.  

2. Support the gut bacteria that transform flavonoids into more beneficial forms.  

3. Improve absorption of flavonoids so more of their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects can be felt in the body.  

   For example: Quercetin is a flavonol known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. However, its bioavailability is relatively low \- meaning the body can’t absorb it very well on its own. But our gut bacteria can [help break](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41522-024-00626-1) quercetin down into smaller pieces that the body can use more easily.  Wasabi (root and leaf) also contains flavonoids. Flavonoids not only act as [antioxidants](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fpls.2022.1043378/full), but can [interact with](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9857828/) our gut bacteria, changing how other flavonoids from the diet are broken down and used. This may boost the overall antioxidant effects in your gut (the gut microbiota plays a crucial role in metabolizing flavonoids, and in turn, flavonoids can affect the composition and activity of the gut microbiota). 

  

This comes down to different but complementary roles that DM-02 and DS-01 play in supporting gut health.

  

🧬 DM-02TM: Fuels and Optimizes What’s Already There

  

DM-02TM provides essential vitamins (like B1, B2, B3, B9, B12), polyphenols (like quercetin), and mitochondrial cofactors (like CoQ10 and PQQ). These:

  

* Feed beneficial microbes (like prebiotics)  

* Support gut barrier repair  

* Enhance microbial function—helping bacteria produce beneficial compounds like butyrate  

* Shift the gut ecosystem toward balance by discouraging harmful microbes

  

Think of DM-02 as the “soil fertilizer”—it nourishes the environment to help good microbes thrive.

  

🦠 DS-01®: Adds Beneficial, Clinically Studied Microbes

  

DS-01® is a probiotic, meaning it introduces live, beneficial bacterial strains that may not be present in your gut—or not present in sufficient numbers. These strains have been selected for their ability to to support whole-body benefits, including:

  

* Digestive Health  

* Gut Barrier Integrity  

* Gut Immune Function / Immune Support  

* Cardiovascular Health / Heart Health  

* Dermatological Health / Skin Health  

* Micronutrient Synthesis  

* Gut Microbial Balance  

* Gut Metabolite Balance

  

This is more like “planting new seeds”—reintroducing or reinforcing beneficial microbes that can support your whole body.

  

🧩 Why Both?

  

Using DM-02TM without DS-01® helps optimize your existing microbes, but doesn’t add new strains. DS-01® brings in those additional “helping hands,” but still needs the right nutrients to survive, grow, and function. Together, they:

  

* Improve both microbial composition (who's there) and function (what they do)  

* Create a more resilient and diverse gut ecosystem  

* Offer broader support for gut, immune, metabolic, cardiovascular and skin health

  

In short:  

 🔹 *DM-02* supports and strengthens your microbiome from the inside.  

 🔹 *DS-01* brings in elite reinforcements to fill in the gaps.

  

Together, they’re more effective than either alone.**

| DM-02™: Product Overview |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| Problem Statement  | Modern life places daily stress on the body and gut—from chronic mental and psychological stress to exposure to pesticides and environmental toxins. At the same time, industrial agriculture has depleted soil, reducing the nutrient density of even the healthiest foods. As a result, nutrient gaps are common, even among those who eat well. The multivitamin category has responded with irrational micro and megadoses—blanket formulations that attempt to “cover the gap” with excessive quantities of nutrients. But more isn’t always better, especially long term. Consumers are left confused about what’s actually safe, what their bodies truly need, and how to make supplementation work with their biology—not against it. |

| Scientific Evidence | Scientific evidence supports the essential role of vitamins A, C, D, B12, and the minerals copper and zinc in maintaining a healthy immune system. Vitamin A is crucial for the integrity of mucosal barriers, while also supporting the production of immune cells. Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that enhances the activity of immune cells. Vitamin D supports immune cell function and helps control inflammation, making it easier for your body to fight infections. Vitamin B12 is essential for making red blood cells, which carry oxygen and nutrients to immune cells so they can do their job properly. Zinc helps your immune system respond quickly to threats, and a lack of it can make you more likely to get sick. Copper is vital for immune defense, helping produce important immune cells and fight off harmful microbes.

### Bioavailability \+ Absorption

| Bioavailability \+ Absorption  |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| Messaging | Bioavailable Ingredients for Maximum Impact Short Experience vitamins and minerals that your body can actually use. We hand-pick bioavailable forms of vitamins and minerals that your body can utilize without the need for conversion, a common absorption issue with other multivitamins.  For example, we use methylfolate for an active form of **B9**, **methylcobalamin** and **adenosylcobalamin** (B12), **pyridoxal-5'-phosphate** (B6), and **chelated minerals** like **manganese bisglycinate**..  Feel the difference of high-quality, bioavailable nutrients that work with your body, not against it. Long Our hand-selected bioavailable nutrient forms ensure your body can fully absorb and utilize essential vitamins and minerals for maximum benefit. By choosing superior forms of key nutrients, we bypass the common issues found with lower-quality vitamins and minerals, like poor absorption, low bioactivity, and inefficient activation due to genetic variations, organ function, or missing cofactors. For example, instead of using **folic acid**, we use **methylfolate**—the active form of vitamin B9—ensuring direct bioavailability for critical functions like DNA synthesis, neurotransmitter production, and homocysteine regulation. Folic acid requires conversion by enzymes in the body, but many people have genetic variations that slow this process. With methylfolate, you get the full benefit without any conversion issues. We also use vitamin D3, the natural form produced by the skin from sunlight, instead of vitamin D2. D3 is more efficiently converted into the active hormone **calcitriol**, raising and maintaining optimal vitamin D levels more effectively with a longer half-life than D2. By using chelated, organic minerals, we ensure better absorption and a more effective delivery of nutrients to your body. |
