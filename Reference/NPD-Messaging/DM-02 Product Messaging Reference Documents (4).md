## **Evergreen Product Messaging ‚Ä¢ DM-02‚Ñ¢ Daily Multivitamin**

| DM-02‚Ñ¢: Product Overview |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| Problem Statement  | Modern life places daily stress on the body and gut‚Äîfrom chronic mental and psychological stress to exposure to pesticides and environmental toxins. At the same time, industrial agriculture has depleted soil, reducing the nutrient density of even the healthiest foods. As a result, nutrient gaps are common, even among those who eat well. The multivitamin category has responded with irrational micro and megadoses‚Äîblanket formulations that attempt to ‚Äúcover the gap‚Äù with excessive quantities of nutrients. But more isn‚Äôt always better, especially long term. Consumers are left confused about what‚Äôs actually safe, what their bodies truly need, and how to make supplementation work with their biology‚Äînot against it. |
| Customer Needs | Proactive support, Bioavailability, Safe quantities, Convenient dosing  |
| Product Description  | DM-02‚Ñ¢ is a 2-in-1 **multivitamin** that helps cover daily nutritional needs, supports immune function and promotes healthy aging by delivering 100% daily value of vitamins and minerals.  Powered by ViaCap¬Æ , Seed‚Äôs proprietary capsule-in-capsule technology, to support the nutritional needs of the body and the microbiome. The outer capsule delivers safe, research-backed quantities of nutrients in bioavailable forms to the body and the inner capsule delivers key vitamins and prebiotics to the microbiome (which has its own unique nutritional needs).  Daily use of DM-02‚Ñ¢ provides consistent intake of micronutrients needed to support the optimal function of the body and the microbiome.  |
| Product Features | 2-in-1 Formula featuring ViaCap¬Æ capsule-in-capsule technology 100% daily value of 20 essential vitamins and minerals Bioavailable and bioactive forms for optimal absorption Safe quantities of micronutrients that complement a healthy diet Designed for daily \+ continuous use More nutrients than a standard multivitamin Contains ingredients like **CoQ10**, **PQQ**, **spermidine**, **Japanese wasabi root** and **quercetin** |
| Key Benefits | Nutritional Coverage, Simplified DM-02‚Ñ¢ helps to fill common nutritional gaps with 100% daily value of 20 key vitamins and minerals in bioavailable forms. It‚Äôs nutritional insurance, simplified into just one daily capsule. 2-in-1 Formula for You and Your Microbiome Engineered for targeted nutrient delivery, the outer capsule delivers vitamins and minerals along the GI tract while the inner capsule delivers key nutrients and prebiotics to the colon‚Äîwhere the microbiome can access nutritional benefits.  Fulfills the Nutritional Needs of the Microbiome The gut microbiome requires more than prebiotics as a source of nutrition. Just like the body, microbes require vitamins to function optimally. DM-02‚Ñ¢ is formulated to deliver key nutrients where you need them most and contains a second formula that fulfills the nutritional needs of the gut microbiome. Long-term Nutrition Maintenance  All vitamins and minerals included in DM-02‚Ñ¢‚Äôs formulation are at research-informed doses, so you can skip the confusing micro or mega doses of most multivitamins and know you‚Äôre getting what‚Äôs best for your body‚Äôs long-term nutrition. **Support Systemic Health**  DM-02‚Ñ¢ is formulated with bioavailable and bioactive forms of nutrients to help fill nutrient gaps, **support immune function**, healthy aging, and **promote strong hair, skin and nails**.  |
| Protocol | Take one capsule daily with food for optimal absorption of vitamins and minerals.  Some nutrients are fat-soluble, meaning they‚Äôre better absorbed when paired with healthy fats. |
| Safety \+ Quality Assurance | Tested for: **Heavy metals  Dairy Gluten Soy Nuts Shellfish Sesame Glyphosate/AMPA** 14 classes of allergens as defined by European Food and Safety Authority (EFSA) No known contraindications |

| Scientific Evidence | Scientific evidence supports the essential role of vitamins A, C, D, B12, and the minerals copper and zinc in maintaining a healthy immune system. Vitamin A is crucial for the integrity of mucosal barriers, while also supporting the production of immune cells. Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that enhances the activity of immune cells. Vitamin D supports immune cell function and helps control inflammation, making it easier for your body to fight infections. Vitamin B12 is essential for making red blood cells, which carry oxygen and nutrients to immune cells so they can do their job properly. Zinc helps your immune system respond quickly to threats, and a lack of it can make you more likely to get sick. Copper is vital for immune defense, helping produce important immune cells and fight off harmful microbes. Together, these nutrients help your body stay protected, recover faster, and fight off infections more effectively.  Vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D, and folate, along with the minerals zinc and copper, are recognized by both Health Canada‚Äôs Natural and Non-prescription Health Products Directorate (NNHPD) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for their essential roles in supporting immune function. According to NNHPD monographs, vitamins [A](https://webprod.hc-sc.gc.ca/nhpid-bdipsn/atReq?atid=multi_vitmin_suppl&lang=eng), [B12](https://webprod.hc-sc.gc.ca/nhpid-bdipsn/atReq?atid=multi_vitmin_suppl&lang=eng), [C](https://webprod.hc-sc.gc.ca/nhpid-bdipsn/atReq?atid=multi_vitmin_suppl&lang=eng), and [D](https://webprod.hc-sc.gc.ca/nhpid-bdipsn/atReq?atid=multi_vitmin_suppl&lang=eng), as well as [zinc](https://webprod.hc-sc.gc.ca/nhpid-bdipsn/atReq?atid=multi_vitmin_suppl&lang=eng), help maintain and support the immune system. Similarly, EFSA has concluded that the intake of vitamins [A](https://ec.europa.eu/food/food-feed-portal/screen/health-claims/eu-register), [B6](https://ec.europa.eu/food/food-feed-portal/screen/health-claims/eu-register), [C](https://ec.europa.eu/food/food-feed-portal/screen/health-claims/eu-register), [folate](https://ec.europa.eu/food/food-feed-portal/screen/health-claims/eu-register), as well as the minerals [zinc](https://ec.europa.eu/food/food-feed-portal/screen/health-claims/eu-register) and [copper](https://ec.europa.eu/food/food-feed-portal/screen/health-claims/eu-register), contributes to the normal function of the immune system. These nutrients are widely acknowledged as critical to maintaining immune health through various biological mechanisms. |

| Scientific Evidence | Healthy aging is inherent to the maintenance of various biological systems and processes such as cardiovascular health, collagen production, hair, skin, and nail health, scavenging of **free radicals**, etc. It may also be extended to compounds that have been shown to decrease with age, and are further associated with positive health outcomes, such as Coenzyme Q10 and PQQ. In [pre-clinical studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19861415/), PQQ has been shown to stimulate the growth of new mitochondria‚Äîthe energy-producing parts of your cells‚Äîand restore healthy mitochondrial function, even in very small amounts. Interestingly, PQQ stays in the body‚Äôs tissues longer than other similar plant compounds, which may help contribute to its powerful and lasting effects on cellular energy. Coenzyme Q10 (Ubiquinone-10), vitamin C, and biotin (vitamin B7) are each recognized by Health Canada's Natural and Non-prescription Health Products Directorate for their important roles in maintaining overall health. [CoQ10](https://webprod.hc-sc.gc.ca/nhpid-bdipsn/atReq?atid=antiox2&lang=eng) supports cardiovascular health and acts as an antioxidant, helping to reduce oxidative stress at the cellular level. [Vitamin C](https://webprod.hc-sc.gc.ca/nhpid-bdipsn/atReq?atid=multi_vitmin_suppl&lang=eng) contributes to the development and maintenance of bones, cartilage, teeth, and gums through its role in collagen formation and connective tissue synthesis. It also supports immune function, assists in nutrient metabolism, and protects cells from oxidative damage. [Biotin](https://webprod.hc-sc.gc.ca/nhpid-bdipsn/atReq?atid=multi_vitmin_suppl&lang=eng) is a key B-complex vitamin that supports normal growth and development, helps maintain the health of skin, hair, and nails, and plays a vital role in energy metabolism and nervous system function. |

Biotin supports **strong nails**, **healthy hair**, and **clear skin,** while also contributing to the maintenance of mucous membranes, which act as a protective barrier for the body. It also plays a role in normal hair and skin pigmentation. Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that contributes to **collagen formation**, a critical protein for maintaining firm, resilient skin, strong nails, and healthy bones. It also helps protect skin from oxidative stress, supporting normal skin function and pigmentation. CoQ10 further supports skin health and cellular function by helping to **reduce oxidative damage**, which can affect skin elasticity and overall appearance. Together, these nutrients work to **nourish and protect hair, skin, nails, and bones**, supporting their strength, structure, and overall health. Biotin (vitamin B7) contributes to the maintenance of healthy hair, nails, mucous membranes, and skin, and supports the body's nutrient metabolism, as recognized by Health Canada's [Natural and Non-prescription Health Products Directorate](https://webprod.hc-sc.gc.ca/nhpid-bdipsn/atReq?atid=multi_vitmin_suppl&lang=eng).

### Bioavailability \+ Absorption

| Bioavailability \+ Absorption  |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| Messaging | Bioavailable Ingredients for Maximum Impact Short Experience vitamins and minerals that your body can actually use. We hand-pick bioavailable forms of vitamins and minerals that your body can utilize without the need for conversion, a common absorption issue with other multivitamins.  For example, we use methylfolate for an active form of **B9**, **methylcobalamin** and **adenosylcobalamin** (B12), **pyridoxal-5‚Äô-phosphate** (B6), and **chelated minerals** like **manganese bisglycinate**..  Feel the difference of high-quality, bioavailable nutrients that work with your body, not against it. Long Our hand-selected bioavailable nutrient forms ensure your body can fully absorb and utilize essential vitamins and minerals for maximum benefit. By choosing superior forms of key nutrients, we bypass the common issues found with lower-quality vitamins and minerals, like poor absorption, low bioactivity, and inefficient activation due to genetic variations, organ function, or missing cofactors. For example, instead of using **folic acid**, we use **methylfolate**‚Äîthe active form of vitamin B9‚Äîensuring direct bioavailability for critical functions like DNA synthesis, neurotransmitter production, and homocysteine regulation. Folic acid requires conversion by enzymes in the body, but many people have genetic variations that slow this process. With methylfolate, you get the full benefit without any conversion issues. We also use vitamin D3, the natural form produced by the skin from sunlight, instead of vitamin D2. D3 is more efficiently converted into the active hormone **calcitriol**, raising and maintaining optimal vitamin D levels more effectively with a longer half-life than D2. By using chelated, organic minerals, we ensure better absorption and a more effective delivery of nutrients to your body. |
