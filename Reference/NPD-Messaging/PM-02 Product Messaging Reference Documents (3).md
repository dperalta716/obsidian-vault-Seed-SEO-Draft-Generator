| PM-02‚Ñ¢: Product Overview |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| Problem Statement  | **Quality sleep** is essential for a healthy mind and body‚Äîyet 1 in 3 Americans struggle to get enough of it. Modern life disrupts natural melatonin and cortisol patterns, making it harder to fall asleep and restore deeply. As you fall asleep, your body‚Äôs melatonin production should increase and cortisol production should go down, cueing your natural sleep cycle. But daily disruptors from **screen time** and **stress** to lifestyle habits affect your ability to unwind at the end of the day and may impact your body‚Äôs production of these key hormones. Most people turn to traditional sleep aids, which just knock you out or flood the body with amounts of melatonin that far exceeds what the brain can naturally produce, disrupting your natural rhythm and ability to rest. |

### Fall Asleep Faster, Stay Asleep 

| üò¥Fall Asleep Faster, Stay Asleep |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| Claims | Please note: when using these claims you must retain the operative description: ‚ÄúPM-02‚Ñ¢ is formulated to‚Äù  GENERAL PM-02‚Ñ¢ is formulated to‚Ä¶ Support the body‚Äôs **natural sleep cycle**  Support better sleep Reduce sleep disturbances/disruptions  Temporal ‚Äì Faster PM-02‚Ñ¢ is formulated to‚Ä¶ Improve/reduce **sleep latency** Help you **fall asleep faster**  Help improve sleep onset PM-02‚Ñ¢ is formulated to‚Ä¶ Regulate/calibrate circadian rhythms  Help realign the body's **sleep-wake cycle** Help increase total sleep time in people suffering from **altered sleep** schedule (e.g. **jet lag**, work schedule)  |
| Scientific Evidence | **Melatonin** In a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating the effects of low dose melatonin in healthy young adults, it was found that taking a low dose of melatonin 2-4 hours before bed increased melatonin levels to sync with the body‚Äôs natural rhythm, supporting the transition to sleep. The results also showed that this dose of melatonin did not cause grogginess or "hangover" effects the next morning, meaning it helped with sleep without making people feel sluggish the next day. Overall, the findings confirm that taking low dose melatonin before bedtime can help people fall asleep faster and enter deeper sleep more quickly‚Äîwithout negative effects on morning wakefulness. **Shoden¬Æ (Ashwagandha)**  In a [double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32540634/), healthy adults with non-restorative sleep took 120 mg of Shoden once a day for 6 weeks.  The results showed that Shoden led to significant improvement in sleep efficiency, total sleep time, sleep latency, and wake after sleep onset.  In addition, Quality of Life assessment indicated significant improvement in areas related to physical, psychological, and environmental domains. |

Both a low dose (60 mg) and regular dose (120 mg) decreased anxiety levels (measured via the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale) and stress levels (measured via the Perceived Stress Scale).  Furthermore, participants displayed lower morning serum cortisol levels. |

| Scientific Evidence  | In a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32540634/) investigating the effects of Shoden¬Æ ashwagandha extract on sleep quality in healthy adults, the group using ashwagandha extract showed significantly better sleep than those taking the placebo. 72% improvement in sleep quality, compared to only 29% in the placebo group. People fell asleep faster (shorter sleep onset latency). People woke up less during the night (lower wake after sleep onset). Total sleep time increased significantly in the ashwagandha group. Sleep efficiency, which measures how well you sleep, was significantly higher in the ashwagandha group compared to placebo. Participants who took ashwagandha also reported significant improvements in physical, psychological, and environmental well-being compared to the placebo group. The greatest benefits were seen in physical and mental health, with people feeling more rested and experiencing better overall well-being. In a [small study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8843534/), using low dose melatonin, participants showed significant decrease in sleep onset latency. The melatonin dose did not cause any "hangover effects", as assessed by self-reporting, as well as mood and performance tests. |
