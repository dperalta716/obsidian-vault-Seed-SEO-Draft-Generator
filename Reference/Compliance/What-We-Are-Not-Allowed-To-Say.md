### What we are and are not allowed to say when writing for Seed

### General: Never refer to probiotics as supplements. 

### Topic: probiotics and bacteria

* "colonization of beneficial microorganisms"  (needs modification or context)  
  * **Alternative phrasing:** presence/action of beneficial microorganisms.  
  * **Notes:** Contrary to popular belief, [science](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3424311/) supports that probiotics are transient (e.g., other than specific cases like [fecal transplants](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8406238/), there’s little evidence that probiotics “colonize” long-term or that colonization is required for benefits. In fact, probiotics travel through the colon and impact resident microbes through complex interactions before being [expelled](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3424311/) through stool, which is why their benefits are generally confined to the time they’re taken.  
* “microflora”  (needs modification or context)  
  * **Alternative phrasing:** microbiota, microorganisms, or microbiome  
  * **Notes:** outdated; context-dependent  
* "competitive exclusion"  (generally accurate; ok to use, given correct context)  
* “high-dose formula”   (needs modification or context)  
  * **Alternative phrasing:** high-potency  
* “guaranteed live delivery”  (needs modification or context)  
  * **Alternative phrasing:** engineered to safeguard bacteria through digestion; engineered to survive digestion  
  * **Notes:** needs more context, also don't want to overpromise/guarantee from a compliance perspective  
* “soil-based organisms”  (needs modification or context)  
  * **Alternative phrasing:** spore-based probiotics; spore-forming probiotics; spore-forming organisms; soil-based microorganisms  
* “maximum strength formula”  (avoid or replace)  
  * **Alternative phrasing:** high-potency formula  
* “professional grade potency”  (avoid or replace)  
  * **Alternative phrasing:** high-potency  
* "prebiotics are food for probiotics"  (generally accurate; ok to use, given correct context)  
* “different strains require different doses”   (generally accurate; ok to use, given correct context)  
  * **Alternative phrasing:** optimal/best/proper dosing can vary by strain and intended benefit  
* “AFU is more accurate than CFU”  \*(\*needs modification or context)  
  * **Alternative phrasing:** AFU is a more precise measurement than CFU

### Topic: gut stuff

* "temporary digestive adjustment period"  (generally accurate; ok to use, given correct context)  
* "microbial changes in the gut environment"  (generally accurate; ok to use, given correct context)  
* "microbial reshuffling"  (generally accurate; ok to use, given correct context)

* "\[if\] your gut microbiome is already imbalanced"   (needs modification or context)  
  * **Alternative phrasing:** if your microbiome has been disrupted by factors like diet, medications, or stress  
  * **Notes:** imbalance is not a formally recognized condition  
* "unless \[symptom\] is severe, there's no need to stop completely"   (needs modification or context)  
* Alternative phrasing: If you experience discomfort, you may consider adjusting your intake and consulting a healthcare provider  
  * **Notes:** verging on medical advice; need to be more passive here  
* "considered generally recognized as safe (GRAS)"  (generally accurate; ok to use, given correct context)  
  * **Notes:** GRAS applies to ingredients, not finished products)  
* “gentle gut activation”   (needs modification or context)  
  * **Alternative phrasing:** supports digestive function  
  * **Notes:** vague; not a recognized effect  
* “acute gut protection”   (needs modification or context)  
  * **Alternative phrasing:** restore gut function after disruption  
  * **Notes:** risky as phrased  
* “Bifidobacterium may influence bowel regularity”  (generally accurate; ok to use, given correct context)  
  * **Notes:** Bifidobacteria → Informal but commonly used to refer to multiple species of Bifidobacterium. (e.g., "Bifidobacteria are important gut microbes.")  
* “supporting recovery of normal digestive patterns”  (generally accurate; ok to use, given correct context)

### Topic: skin microbiome

* "dermal rebalancing"  (needs modification or context)  
  * **Alternative phrasing:** supports a balanced skin microbiome  
  * **Notes:** vague; not widely recognized effect/med term  
* “skin ecosystem”  (generally accurate; ok to use, given correct context)

### Topic: vaginal microbiome

* "vaginal microflora"  (avoid or replace)  
  * **Alternative phrasing:** vaginal microbiota  
  * **Notes:** outdated  
* “vaginal ecosystem”  (generally accurate; ok to use, given correct context)  
* "restoring normal vaginal pH levels"  (\*needs modification or context)  
  * **Alternative phrasing:** support healthy vaginal pH levels  
  * **Notes:** context dependent but could be risky  
* "Lactobacillus strains naturally found in vaginal environment"  (generally accurate; ok to use, given correct context)  
* "temporary shifts in vaginal flora composition"  (generally accurate; ok to use, given correct context)  
* "vaginal microbiome fluctuates throughout menstrual cycle"  (generally accurate; ok to use, given correct context)

### Topic: gas

* "gas might actually be a good sign"   (needs modification or context)  
  * **Alternative phrasing:** gas may indicate that microbes are active  
  * **Notes:** need to be more neutral to avoid misleading; gas can come from other sources too  
* "Bifidobacterium species generally cause minimal gas"   (needs modification or context)  
  * **Notes:** very broad/generalized and results can vary based on the individual, so important not to over-promise when it comes to effects  
* "Lactobacillus acidophilus tends to produce less gas than other strains"   (needs modification or context)  
  * **Notes:** very broad/generalized and results can vary based on the individual, so important not to over-promise when it comes to effects  
* "synbiotics may temporarily increase gas production"   (generally accurate; ok to use, given correct context)  
  * Notes: also true of probiotics  
* "transient gas can be a sign that probiotics are active"   (needs modification or context)  
  * **Alternative phrasing:** gas may indicate that microbes are active  
  * **Notes:** need to be more neutral to avoid misleading; gas can come from other sources too  
* "die-off reactions"  (avoid or replace)

  * **Notes:** not necessarily true; tolerance can vary based on strains, dosage, delivery system, and other ingredients

### General recommendations

* “cycle different strains periodically”   (needs modification or context)  
  * **Notes:** not necessarily warranted; We wrote about that HERE: [https://seed.com/cultured/cycling-rotating-probiotics/](https://seed.com/cultured/cycling-rotating-probiotics/)   
* “starting with smaller doses”  (generally accurate; ok to use, given correct context)  
* **Notes:** not universally necessary but not incorrect  
* “gradually increasing doses”  (generally accurate; ok to use, given correct context)  
  * **Notes:** not universally necessary but not incorrect  
* “alternating days for sensitive individuals”   (needs modification or context)  
  * **Notes:** not necessarily warranted; people can experiment with a lower dose, they may miss out on the full spectrum of benefits of the clinically studied/supported dose  
* “taking probiotics with meals to minimize digestive symptoms”   (generally accurate; ok to use, given correct context)  
  * **Notes:** not universally necessary but not incorrect  
* “drinking extra water when starting probiotics”   (needs modification or context)  
  * **Notes:** not necessarily warranted; no increased need for water during this time, generally helpful for most folks to drink water though)  
* “separating probiotic intake from medications by 2 hours”   (avoid or replace)  
  * **Alternative phrasing:**  if you're taking any medications, check with your doctor or pharmacist about the best probiotic timing for your routine  
  * **Notes:** not a blanket rule \- largely dependent on the type of medication being referenced; ex: meds/supps that promote laxation \+ antibiotics may benefit from being spaced out; there's some evidence to suggest thyroid meds should be spaced out  
* “introducing prebiotic foods slowly alongside probiotics   (generally accurate; ok to use, given correct context)  
  * **Notes:** not universally necessary but not incorrect  
* recommending prebiotic rich foods vs. encouraging using a synbiotic   (avoid or replace)  
  * **Notes:** not an either-or situation, ideally it's great to have both. A synbiotic can't replace the volume/variety of prebiotic foods from diet; foods may not provide a consistent source of targeted types of prebiotics for certain indications  
* eating yogurt (or other foods like this)  (*needs modification or context)*  
  * **Notes:** needs context; but generally fine to do\! probiotic foods can contain varying amounts of viable probiotic bacteria; we wrote about that [HERE](https://seed.com/cultured/fermented-foods-vs-probiotics/))

### Miscellaneous questions

**Q1: Should I even mention other beneficial species and strains if they are not in Seed’s formulations? (ex: S. boulardii)**  
A1: I encourage this\! It gives the reader necessary context to understand the full body of research (versus us just pushing a product)

**Q2: Are there any specific research articles that are off-limits? What about parameters you want me to watch for (like after a certain year)?**  
A2: To add to what Kate said (RCTs, meta analyses, and systematic reviews within the past 10 years are my general rec), my biggest note/piece of feedback on this would be to double-check that the sentence/section we're citing is supported by the linked study.   
Things to look for:

* Is the population broadly applicable (i.e. healthy adults or whoever we're talking about in the article) or is it narrow (i.e. people with a certain condition, kids, elderly people)  
* Was this a study in people? Or was it a rat study? Lab study (i.e. in vitro)? If we're talking about the latter two, it's important to give the reader some context (ex: A study in rats showed XYZ; it's important to note that this finding came from research in a lab, not in humans)  
* Is the outcome/benefit we're talking about something that was covered in the study? Or was it possible that AI hallucinated or there was an error/oversimplification that happened?


**Q3: Are there any specific Seed articles or pages I should be linking more frequently?**  
A3: Not specifically, but cross-referencing other Cultured articles and checking for congruence seems like a smart idea for us and our readers :)
