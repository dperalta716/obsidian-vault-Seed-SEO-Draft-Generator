## Study 1: Overviews of Biological Importance of Quercetin: A Bioactive Flavonoid
**Link**: [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5214562/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5214562/)

### Claims
✅ Quercetin is a polyphenol (flavonoid) that functions as a versitile antioxidant
✅ Quercetin is a plant pigment that functions as a potent antioxidant
✅ Quercetin is a flavonoid that is primarily found in onions, grapes, berries, cherries, broccoli, and citrus fruits
✅ Quercetin cannot be produced by the human body
✅ Quercetin is derived from the Latin word "Quercetum," meaning Oak Forest

### Supporting Material
One of the core most remarkable properties of quercetin is its ability to modulate inflammation. Quercetin inhibits inflammatory enzymes cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipooxygenase thereby decreasing inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes.[16,17]

Nutrition scientists from Michigan State University explored the impact of dietary flavonoids such as quercetin in their general roles as systemic anti-inflammatory agents.[18] Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are associated with numerous disease states such as obesity, heart disease, and lupus. It has been identified through this study that intake of certain foods can lower the levels of the inflammatory risk factor (CRP). In preclinical in vitro studies, quercetin showed a significant reduction in the levels of inflammatory mediators such as NO synthase, COX-2, and CRP in human hepatocyte-derived cell line.[19] In rats, quercetin (80 mg equivalent dose) inhibited both acute and chronic inflammation and also showed significant antiarthritic activity against adjuvant-induced arthritis.[20,21]

### Support for Claim
High

### Notes/Caveats
General characterization of quercetin as an antioxidant that is present in various plant-sources is permissible. Avoid further connecting this to any specific health outcomes (e.g., endothelial [dys-] function)

## Study 2: Systematic Review on Polyphenol Intake and Health Outcomes: Is there Sufficient Evidence to Define a Health-Promoting Polyphenol-Rich Dietary Pattern?

### Claims
✅ Daily average polyphenol intake in US is estimated to be ~800mg/day
✅ Studies have indicated higher polyphenol intake is associated with positive cardiovascular- (1170mg/day) and metabolic (2632mg/day) health
✅ Quercetin helps close / bridge the [polyphenol] intake gap by providing a purified source [of polyphenols]

Potential to further combine / recommend to take with DS-01 as the pomegranate extract is also a source of polyphenols.

### Supporting Material
Polyphenol intake is also affected by intrinsic factors such as the geographical area, the population characteristics in term of age, gender and socio-cultural factors and above all the dietary habits. In this regard, we have found that the intake of total polyphenols is higher in Japan (about 1500 mg/day) compared to European countries and North and South America (about 900 mg/day and 800 mg/day respectively). Within Europe, we found a large variability of intake between countries; Poland and France had the highest intake of total polyphenols (above 1000 mg/day), followed by Italy (about 650 mg/day) and Spain (about 300 mg/day). Conversely, within the EPIC study, Denmark showed the highest intake of total polyphenols (1786 mg/day) while Greece the lowest (584 mg/day).

Extensive research on polyphenols in human studies has shown a potential role of these compounds in the modulation of CVD markers [*]. In the present systematic review, we found an overall inverse association between total polyphenol intake (highest quantile, above 1170 mg/day) and CV risk events and mortality. In addition, an increased protection against T2D events was observed for total polyphenol intake (mean intake of the 4th quartile) higher than 2632 mg/day [*].

### Study Dose

### Dose Matched
N/A

### Support for Claim
Medium

### Notes/Caveats
Quercetin is present at 5mg/serving which is fairly negligible. However, AM is intended to supplement the diet, thereby providing additional background levels that close the overall intake gap. Hence, support for claim is medium and not high.
