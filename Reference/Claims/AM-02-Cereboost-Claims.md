### Dose Matched
Yes

### Support for Claim
High

### Notes/Caveats
Not statistically significant for mood or alphabetic WM speed in 200mg group whereas there was significance for the other doses administered (indicating differential sensitivity of biological systems to specific neural substrates affected by ginseng and its constituent ginsenosides).

- Immediate word recall = Short-term / Verbal Declarative Memory (1, 3, and 6H.)

Verbal Declarative Memory: Declarative memory comprises both semantic memory for knowledge and facts as well as episodic memory for events. The loss of declarative memory, particularly episodic memory, is one of the hallmarks of the amnesic syndrome and declarative episodic memory is what people typically mean when using everyday terms such as "memory" and "remembering."

- Choice Reaction Time = attention (6H.)
- Numeric Working Memory = working memory (1, 3, and 6H.)
- Corsi block test = working memory (1, 3, and 6H.)

### Supporting Material
For performance accuracy during the ANT task, the acute analysis revealed significant treatment [F(1,414.98) = 20.50, p < 0.001], and treatment × session [F(2,409.60) = 4.70, p = 0.010] effects. Pairwise comparisons revealed accuracy to be greater following Cereboost® treatment at the 4 h and 6 h test sessions (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). Effect sizes were d = 0.96 [0.30, 1.39] at 4 h and d = 1.25 [0.68, 1.81] at 6 h. A significant reduction in accuracy was observed for the placebo treatment between the 2 h and 4 h sessions (p = 0.044), and between the 2 h and 6 h sessions (p = 0.001), suggestive of an acute maintenance effect of Cereboost® treatment. A significant treatment x congruency effect [F(1,414.96) = 20.63, p < 0.001] also revealed that Cereboost® treatment outperformed placebo treatment on incongruent trials (p < 0.001; d = 1.63 [1.03,2.22]), indicating a benefit on more cognitively challenging trials. For ANT reaction time, the acute analysis revealed a significant treatment × session interaction [F(2,433.97) = 3.57, p = 0.029]. Pairwise comparisons indicated faster reaction times for the Cereboost® treatment at the 2 h test session (p = 0.025; d = 0.60 [0.07,1.13]), compared with the placebo treatment.

For the primary outcome measure, chronic Cereboost® supplementation for 14 days resulted in significantly fewer RVIP commission errors compared to placebo [F(1,55) = 4.22, p = 0.045]; d = 0.55 [0.03,1.07]. Similarly, a significant effect of treatment on ANT accuracy was observed [F(1,433) = 6.29, p = 0.012] with Cereboost® outperforming placebo following 14 days treatment, d = 0.66 [0.14,1.18]. Unlike accuracy, however, no significant chronic effects were seen for ANT reaction time. The mood analysis revealed significant treatment effects for mental fatigue 1 [F(1,58) = 6.07, p = 0.017], which was mirrored in the PANAS-X fatigue measure [F(1,58) = 6.48, p = 0.014]. The PANAS-X self-assurance measure was also significant [F(1,58) = 5.84, p = 0.019]. In all cases, mood was better for the Cereboost® treatment compared with the placebo treatment. Effect sizes were d = 0.65 [0.13,1.18] for mental fatigue 1, d = 0.68 [0.15,1.20] for PANAS-X fatigue, and d = 0.64 [0.12,1.17] for PANAS-X self-assurance. No chronic effects were observed for Corsi blocks, the switching task, or immediate and delayed recall.

For the ANT task, a significant effect of treatment was observed for accuracy performance [F(1,369.09) = 20.76, p < 0.001]. Pairwise comparisons indicated significantly better performance for the Cereboost® treatment compared to placebo at all postprandial test sessions (2 h, p = 0.001; 4 h, p = 0.003; 6 h, p < 0.001). Effect sizes were d = 0.85 [0.30,1.39] at 2 h, d = 0.77 [0.23,1.31] at 4 h, and d = 1.05 [0.49–1.61] at 6 h. A significant reduction in accuracy was observed for the placebo treatment between the 2 h and 6 h sessions (p = 0.046), and between the 4 h and 6 h sessions (p = 0.035). For ANT reaction time, a significant treatment effect was observed [F(1,401.45) = 14.43, p < 0.001], with overall faster performance for the Cereboost® treatment compared with the placebo treatment. Pairwise comparisons revealed consistently faster performance for the Cereboost® treatment at all three test sessions (2 h, p = 0.032; 4 h, p < 0.001; 6 h, p = 0.036). Effect sizes were d = 0.59 [0.05,1.12] at 2 h, d = 1.30 [0.72,1.88] at 4 h, and d = 0.57 [0.04,1.11] at 6 h. Cereboost® reaction times sped up between 2 and 4 h (p < 0.001) but slowed again between 4 and 6 h (p = 0.001). The switching task revealed a significant effect of treatment for task reaction time [F(1,55.29) = 4.51, p = 0.038], with overall faster performance for the Cereboost® treatment compared with the placebo treatment.

### Study Dose

### Notes/Caveats
Reaction times for the placebo treatment were observed to speed up between 2 and 6 h (p = 0.016), and between 4 and 6 h (p = 0.049). No acute benefits of Cereboost® were observed for the primary RVIP task, Corsi blocks, mood measures, the switching task, or immediate and delayed recall. ANT RT, Corsi blocks, switching task, or immediate and delayed recall not sustained at two weeks.

### Claims
✅ Activates / stimulates [prefrontal] areas / regions of brain [to support cognitive function...]
✅ Promotes efficient neural processing in key areas / regions of the brain [to support cognitive function...]

### Supporting Material
Task windows of the active SWM task condition were contrasted between the P. quinquefolius treatment visit and the placebo visit, in order to quantify transient changes in SSVEP response during task processing associated with the acute dose of P. quinquefolius. The overall trend in these comparisons was for latency reductions in prefrontal sites, while amplitude tended to be lower in occipital sites and higher in centro-parietal regions (see Figure 2). Hotelling's T2 comparisons of the two treatments showed significant latency reductions in the retrieval (probe) task phase at the P. quinquefolius treatment visit in prefrontal electrode sites (p < .01; Fp1, Fp2 and AFz; p < .05: Fpz and AF3).

### Claims
✅ Supports working memory [in healthy middle-age adults]
✅ Supports healthy cognitive function [in middle-age adults]

### Supporting Material
Inspection of the individual task outcomes contribution to the working memory factor showed that there was a significant Treatment×Time interaction [F(2,86)=3.891,p=0.024] on the initial ANOVA (Table 2 and Figure 1) for Spatial Working Memory sensitivity index. Compared with placebo, Cereboost™ was associated with an improvement on this task at 3h (p=0.022) with a trend towards a significant improvement at 6h post treatment (p=0.058)

### Study Dose
200mg

### Dose Matched
Yes

### Support for Claim
Low

### Notes/Caveats
Does not unlock net-new claims as results are not overly compelling. Overall utility is likely limited to discussing middle-age population in particular and want to mention these stats. Support for claim is low in isolation, but medium-to-high when considered in the totality of evidence for general cognitive function claims in healthy adults.

No statistically significant between-arm difference for any other measure on CDR battery (i.e., secondary memory, speed of memory, accuracy of attention, or speed of attention factors) aside from Spatial WM (Sensitivity Index) and Working Memory (SI X 2).

### Supporting Material
Lactobacillus spp. levels remained unaffected during treatment with Cereboost® in the luminal and mucosal PC. However, in the DC, Cereboost® supplementation resulted in enhanced Lactobacillus levels, with a clear trend in the mucosal environment (p = 0.066). Bifidobacterium levels decreased significantly in the mucosal environment of both the PC and DC during Cereboost® treatment (p = 0.004 and p < 0.001, respectively). Overall, Bacteroidetes levels remained largely unaffected during treatment with Cereboost®, with the exception a significant reduction in the mucosal DC (p = 0.001). Conversely, Firmicutes levels were significantly reduced in all colonic areas upon Cereboost® supplementation. Finally, while Akkermansia muciniphila remained below the limit of detection in the mucosal environment, treatment with Cereboost® resulted in a significant enrichment of Akkermansia muciniphila levels in the luminal DC (p = 0.002).

### Supporting Material
Cereboost™ reduced the cytotoxicity in a concentration-dependent manner. Especially, it significantly increased in the viability up to 88.54% and 93.24% at concentrations of 316 and 1000 mg/ml, respectively.

In passive avoidance performances, the increase in retention time in the mice injected with Aβ1-42 (5 mg) was markedly retarded, in comparison with a steep increase in vehicle-treated animals following repeated trials (Fig. 4A). By comparison, daily oral treatment with Cereboost™ (30, 100 or 300 mg/kg) remarkably ameliorated the memory deficits, although there was only a narrow dose-difference.

In Morris water-maze performances, repeated trials rapidly shortened the escape latency in normal mice, while Aβ1-42 treatment markedly retarded the acquisition of information (Fig. 4B). However, daily administration of Cereboost™ remarkably attenuated the Aβ1-42-induced cognitive impairment, although no dose dependency was observed.

Administration of Aβ1-42 markedly increased the brain Aβ level (Fig. 5). However, accumulation of Aβ was attenuated by treatment with Cereboost™, in which 300 mg/kg remarkably reduced the Aβ concentration.

In the analysis of neuronal markers to confirm the neuronal integrity, the levels of MAP2 (a neuronal skeletal protein) and synaptophysin (a presynaptic membrane protein) were drastically reduced in the brain of mice treated with Aβ1-42 (Fig. 5). However, their concentrations were greatly restored, comparable to control levels, in mice treated with Cereboost™ (30–300 mg/kg).

Injection of Aβ1-42 peptide reduced ACh concentration in the brain tissue by 40% (Fig. 6), indicative of a relationship between memory deficit and the decrease in ACh level. Such a decrease in ACh concentration was significantly recovered by treatment with Cereboost™ (30–300 mg/kg) in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, a high dose (300 mg/kg) of Cereboost™ near-fully recovered ACh concentration to the control level.

### Notes/Caveats
While the support for claims derived from this study is LOW overall in isolation, it provides a foundation for the mechanistic effects of ginsenosides from a neuroprotective standpoint that further reinforces and complements direct RCT findings pertaining to improved cognitive function. For example, Scholey et al. (2010) observed significant improvements in various modalities of cognitive function including short-term memory and attention. While this RCT did not directly evaluate "neuroprotection," preclinical evidence can be used to extrapolate and underpin these findings to provide a holistic representation. In essence, by virtue of the neuroprotective properties of ginensoides in vitro, and coupling these findings with those observed in an RCT setting, conflation is considered to be low risk (e.g., Exhibits neuroprotective properties that help support acute and sustained cognitive support).
