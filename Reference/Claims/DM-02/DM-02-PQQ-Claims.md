# DM-02 PQQ (1mg) Claims Substantiation

## Study 1: Pyrroloquinoline quinone stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis through cAMP response element-binding protein phosphorylation and increased PGC-1alpha expression

### Claims
✅ PQQ supports mitochondrial biogenesis

### Supporting Material
PQQ stimulates mitochondriogenesis with the addition of only milligram quantities of PQQ per kg of diet, or micromolar concentrations, in vivo. For example, PQQ deprivation depresses mitochondrial function, which is reversed when as little as 200–300 μg of PQQ/kg of diet are added (1, 10). PQQ also remains detectable in tissues when there is no or little dietary exposure (11), which has not been observed for other dietary polyphenolic compounds known to promote mitochondriogenesis.

### Study Dose
Statement of fact. No dose required; claim based on physiological function of CoQ10 in body

### Dose Matched
N/A

### Support for Claim
High

### Notes/Caveats
None specified

## Study 2: Potential physiological importance of PQQ
**Link**: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26869770_Potential_physiological_importance_of_PQQ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26869770_Potential_physiological_importance_of_PQQ)

### Claims
✅ Space-Age Nutrient—Found in Comet Dust, Believed to Have Helped Seed Life on Earth
✅ Cosmic Nutrient—From Comet Dust to Life on Earth

### Supporting Material
From an evolutionary perspective, current evidence suggests PQQ is a component of interstellar dust as analyzed by particle impact time-of-flight mass spectrometry.[*][*] Cometary grains are considered to be the precursors of organic materials in early life on the earth. It can also be argued that strong redox catalysts would be required to trigger the earliest chemical evolutionary steps. The presence of PQQ in stellar dust raises the question of PQQ's evolutionary importance to simpler life forms, given its wide range of chemical properties, such as redox catalysis and the ability to carry out useful amino acid modifications (e.g., oxidative deamination reactions).

### Study Dose
N/A—based on presence of PQQ in comet dust

### Dose Matched
N/A

### Support for Claim
High

### Notes/Caveats
PQQ has been found in comet dust, leading to speculation that it may have been present in the materials that seeded life on Earth from space, potentially playing an early role in the development of life on our planet. This is not intended to be a structure-function claim, but rather, provide a narrative that intertwines with Seed's foundation and exploration.
