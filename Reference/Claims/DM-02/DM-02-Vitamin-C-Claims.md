### Claims
✅ Helps in the development and maintenance of bones
✅ Helps in collagen formation to maintain/support healthy bones
✅ Helps in the development and maintenance of bones/cartilage/teeth/(and) gums
✅ Helps in connective tissue formation
✅ Source of/Provides (an) antioxidant(s) for the maintenance of good health
✅ Source of/Provides (an) antioxidant(s) that help(s) fight/protect (cell) against/reduce (the oxidative effect of/the oxidative damage caused by/cell damage caused by) free radicals
✅ Helps in collagen formation (to maintain/support healthy bones/cartilage/teeth/(and) gums)
✅ Helps to maintain/support immune function/the immune system
✅ Helps to maintain/support the body's ability to metabolize nutrients†

### Supporting Material
See MVM and Joint Health Monographs

### Study Dose
6—2,000mg

### Dose Matched
Yes

### Support for Claim
High

### Notes/Caveats
†These vitamins are cofactors in specific biochemical reactions (e.g. inter-conversion of amino acids). This claim is not intended to convey that taking these vitamins helps to boost metabolism, upregulate a bodily system and/or directly convert food to energy. Inferring such claims would be misleading and is not permitted. In order to avoid any misinterpretation of this claim, the terms 'carbohydrates, fats, proteins, etc.' must not be used to further specify the term 'nutrients'.

**Link**: [https://ec.europa.eu/food/food-feed-portal/screen/health-claims/eu-register](https://ec.europa.eu/food/food-feed-portal/screen/health-claims/eu-register)

### Claims
✅ Contributes to the normal function of the immune system
✅ Contributes to the protection of cell constituents from oxidative damage; antioxidant
✅ Contributes to normal collagen formation [and the normal function of bones, teeth, cartilage, gums, skin, and blood vessels]
✅ Contributes to normal energy-yielding metabolism
✅ Contributes to normal functioning of the nervous system
✅ Contributes to normal psychological function
✅ Contributes to the reduction of tiredness and fatigue
✅ Contributes to the regeneration of the reduced form of vitamin E
✅ Increases iron absorption

### Supporting Material
See EFSA Health Claims

### Study Dose
N/A

### Dose Matched
Yes

### Support for Claim
High

### Notes/Caveats
The Panel considers that in order to bear the claims a food should be at least a source of vitamin C as per Annex to Regulation 1924/2006. Such amounts can be easily consumed as part of a balanced diet. The target population is the general population.

Claims should be maintained within the context of normal physiological function(s)—not direct structure-function claims.

## Study 4: Immune Function Support
**Link**: [Add link here]

### Claims
✅ Plays a critical role in [healthy] immune function
✅ Maintains immune function by supporting lymphocytes and white blood cells

### Supporting Material
Ascorbic acid has an extensive role in the immune system. Its role in phagocytic cells like neutrophils, has been investigated thoroughly and was recently reviewed [7]. In summary, AA enhances chemotaxis and phagocytosis of phagocytes and thereby promotes microbial killing.

### Study Dose
NA

### Dose Matched
Yes

### Support for Claim
High

### Notes/Caveats
Must be in the context of physiological mechanisms—not direct health claim

## Study 5: Collagen Synthesis Support
**Link**: [Add link here]

### Claims
✅ Supports collagen synthesis/contributes to normal collagen formation [by playing a critical role in the hydroxylation of the amino acid—proline]
✅ Critical co-factor for collagen synthesis

### Supporting Material
Biochemical studies further demonstrated that vitamin C is a co-factor for lysyl and prolyl hydroxylase, two essential enzymes in the collagen biosynthesis pathway [1–3]. Lysyl and prolyl hydroxylase catalyse the hydroxylation of lysine and proline residues on the collagen polypeptide, and these post-translational modifications allow the formation/stabilization of the collagen triple helix, and its subsequent secretion in to the extracellular space as procollagen.

Consequently, collagen hydroxylation is a critical step in collagen biosynthesis as it governs triple helix formation, procollagen excretion and tropocollagen cross-linking. This hydroxylation is achieved by two iron enzymes, lysyl and prolyl hydroxylase. Vitamin C, as a co-factor, prevents iron oxidation, and thus protects these enzymes against auto-inactivation. Thus, vitamin C promotes the synthesis of a normal mature collagen network by maintaining optimal lysyl and prolyl hydroxylse activity

Must be in the context of physiological mechanisms—not direct health claim

## Study 6: Antioxidant Function
**Link**: [Add link here]

### Claims
✅ Vitamin C helps to scavenge and neutralize free radicals, protecting the body against oxidative stress; antioxidant

### Supporting Material
Ascorbic acid functions as a cofactor, enzyme complement, co-substrate, and a powerful anti-oxidant in a variety of reactions and metabolic processes. It also stabilizes vitamin E and folic acid and enhances iron absorption. It neutralizes free radicals and toxins as well as attenuates inflammatory response, including sepsis syndrome

### Study Dose
NA

### Dose Matched
Yes

### Support for Claim
Not specified

### Notes/Caveats
Must be in the context of physiological mechanisms—not direct health claim
