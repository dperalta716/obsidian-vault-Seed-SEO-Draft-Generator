## Study 1: Coenzyme Q10 supplementation—In ageing and disease
**Link**: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047637421000932](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047637421000932)

### Claims
✅ CoQ10 production decreases with age
✅ CoQ10 production begins to decline at 20 years old [and reduced to about half by age 80]
✅ CoQ10 levels are negatively impacted by certain/common prescriptions [thereby increasing the need for supplementation]

### Supporting Material
The endogenous production of CoQ10 decreases after the age of 20, and the myocardial concentration of CoQ10 is reduced to about half at the age of 80 (Fig. 3) (Kalén et al., 1989; Gutierrez-Mariscal et al., 2019).

Of interest in this context is that the endogenous synthesis of CoQ10 is inhibited by certain classes of drugs such as statins and bisphosphonates, often used by elderly people (Littarru and Langsjoen, 2007). Statins are inhibitors of the synthesis of mevalonate, an intermediate molecule acting as a precursor for both cholesterol and CoQ10. In an in vitro skin model, statin addition resulted in CoQ10 deprivation and signs of ageing, but upon addition of CoQ10 to the medium, the tissue levels could be restored, and markers of ageing were reduced (Marcheggiani et al., 2021). The reduced form, CoQ10H2, appeared more bioavailable and even improved oxidative status of mitochondria. Statins are extensively used in the treatment of several abnormalities associated with the age-related diseases in the cardiovascular system, such as hypercholesterolemia, particularly after heart infarction and stroke, and such treatment may reduce the plasma levels of circulating CoQ10 (Nawarskas, 2005). In some patients, statins may cause side effects, such as myalgia and general discomfort, which have been attributed inter alia to the inhibition of coenzyme CoQ10 synthesis (Mollazadeh et al., 2021). It is well-established that depletion of coenzyme Q10 has an association with myopathies due to abnormal function of mitochondria in the cell. Although a part of the statin-induced lowering of CoQ10 could be explained by a decrease in the circulating levels of LDL-cholesterol, it is relevant here that statins also reduce the levels of CoQ10 in blood platelets. Furthermore, it has been observed that the combination therapy of the statin simvastatin and an inhibitor of intestinal cholesterol absorption, ezetimibe, reduced the levels of CoQ10, while treatment with ezetimibe alone did not reduce these levels (Berthold et al., 2006).

### Claims
✅ CoQ10 is a fat-soluble vitamin-like compound that is found in every cellular membrane in the body

### Supporting Material
CoQ10, also called ubiquinone, is a fat-soluble, vitamin-like molecule found naturally in every cellular membrane in our bodies and a normal part of our diet, though endogenously synthesized. CoQ10 is crucial for efficiently transferring electrons within the mitochondrial oxidative respiratory chain and producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

### Claims
✅ CoQ10 works on the cellular level to fuel mitochondria [and generate ATP]
✅ Provides mitochondrial (cellular energy / ATP) support
✅ Powerful antioxidant/can support the mitochondria in repairing itself
✅ Supports healthy aging [by reducing oxidative stress; antioxidative]
✅ Antioxidant optimizer / potentiator / bridge / recycler

### Supporting Material
The main function of CoQ10 in mitochondria is to transfer electrons to complex III (CIII). By transferring two electrons to CIII, the reduced form of CoQ10 (ubiquinol) is oxidized to ubiquinone. The pool of ubiquinol can be restored by accepting electrons either from members of the electron transport chain (CI and CII), glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) that use cytosolic electron donors, or from acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs); (2) CoQ10 is also a structural component of both CI and CIII and is associated with respiratory supercomplexes, especially the depicted supercomplex I+III+IV; (3) CoQ10 is an obligatory factor in proton transport by uncoupling proteins (UCPs) with concomitant regulation of mitochondrial activity.

Cell membrane activities of CoQ10. Present in nearly all cellular membranes, CoQ10 offers antioxidant protection, in part, by maintaining the reduced state of α-tocopherol (α-TOC) and ascorbic acid (ASC). Furthermore, CoQ10 also regulates apoptosis by preventing lipid peroxidation. Other functions of CoQ10 in cell membrane include metabolic regulation, cell signaling, and cell growth through local regulation of cytosolic redox intermediates such as NAD(P)H.

The anti-oxidant function of CoQ is especially important in the plasma membrane by reducing vitamins C and E, and in preventing ceramide-mediated apoptosis, an important regulator of lifespan in the context of normal aging.

## Study 5: Role of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) in cardiac disease, hypertension and Meniere-like syndrome

### Claims
✅ Supports heart health / cardiovascular function
✅ Support healthy aging [by promoting cardiovascular / heart health]

### Supporting Material
Cardiac contraction occurs after Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) which activates the contractile proteins. During diastole, cytosolic Ca2+ re-sequesters into the SR. The cardiac contraction and the uptake of free cytoplasmic calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum is an energy-requiring mechanism (Kayo & Carsten, 2005). Myocardial relaxation which is dependent on active Ca2+ uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum is not a passive process. Rather this latter step requires more energy. In cardiac failure, changes in Ca2+ transport and metabolism have also been found (Marin-Garcia et al., 2001). Myocardial failure may be related to decreased energy production by the mitochondria. There is a decrease in energy availability for Ca2+ uptake in SR (diastolic failure) and for delivery to the contractile apparatus impairing cross bridge cycling (systolic failure).Since CoQ10 participates in the transport of electrons from organic substrates to oxygen in the respiratory chain of mitochondria with the production of energy, it has a role in providing energy for the functioning of the failing and energy depleted heart.

Heart failure is often characterized by an energy depletion status that has been associated with low endogenous CoQ10 levels. Its levels are depleted in both serum and myocardial tissue samples of patients with chronic heart failure (Folkers et al., 1970, 1985). The myocardial tissue levels in CHF patients are on average 33% lower than in control patients. Patients with severe CHF, namely New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes III and IV, tend to have lower levels of endogenous CoQ10 than that of patients with NYHA class I CHF or healthy subjects and may be more likely to attain a favourable clinical response to CoQ10 supplementation (Mortensen et al., 1984). The need for measurement of plasma CoQ10 is based on the relationship betweenlevels andoutcomes,as in chronic heart failure,where it may identify individuals most likely to benefit from supplementation therapy.

### Study Dose
Statement of fact. No dose required; claim based on physiological function of CoQ10 in body

### Dose Matched
N/A

### Support for Claim
High

### Notes/Caveats
Claims should be characterized within the context of mechanistic/physiological effects rather than direct structure-function/health claims. CoQ10, for example, often requires a much higher dose to confer direct CV health outcomes (e.g., reduction in blood pressure). This may be further connected to "healthy aging," as cardiovascular health is essential to promote longevity.
