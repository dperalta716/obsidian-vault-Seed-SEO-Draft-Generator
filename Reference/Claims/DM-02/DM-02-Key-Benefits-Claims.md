# DM-02 Key Benefits Claims

## Important Note
ðŸ›‘ **ALL CLAIMS** ðŸ›‘

All claims are ingredient-based. As a result, accompanying claims should reflect this (e.g., DM-02 is formulated to..., DM-02 contains ingredients that support..., x ingredient in DM-02 supports...) And not imply the composition has been validated for any specific health outcome (e.g., DM-02 supports..., DM-02 has been shown to...., DM-02 is clinically validated [to]...)

## Claim 1: High Potency Multivitamin
**Link**: [Add link here]

### Claim
âœ… [High potency] multivitamin with 20 essential vitamins and minerals [in water- and lipid-soluble forms]

### Substantiation
Statement of fact. Product formulation consists of 20 essential vitamins and minerals. See FORMULATION details

### Caveats
"Water and lipid soluble forms" is accurate given we have fat-soluble vitamins present (A, D, E, K), but we do not utilize complementary water- and lipid-soluble vitamers (e.g., ascorbic acid and ascorbyl palmitate). As a result, emphasis should not be placed on utilizing combined/complementary solubility profiles, but rather, on the inherent solubility of the vitamins/minerals themselves.

## Claim 2: Multi-pathway Absorption
**Link**: [Add link here]

### Claim
âœ… Multi-pathway absorption of key nutrients

### Substantiation
Cap-in-cap release profile inherently distributes outer capsule contents to the stomach while the inner capsule dissolves ~3H. following consumption, thereby delivering contents to varying anatomical regions, including the distal ileum, that otherwise likely not come into contact with the compound(s). Additionally, the utilization of complementary vitameric forms were included when applicable to further facilitate and diversify ADME.

### Caveats
Some forms of vitamins, such as B12 and B6, include bioidentical forms while other vitamins, such as B1, B2, are standard/generic forms.

## Claim 3: Immune Function Support
**Link**: [Add link here]

### Claim
âœ… Supports immune function

### Substantiation
See Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Zinc, and Copper for immune-support/function claims.

### Caveats
Must be in the context of "maintaining," "supporting," "contributing to" the normal function of the immune system. Modifiers such as "boosts," "improves," etc. should not be used to characterize immune-health claims.

## Claim 4: Healthy Aging Support
**Link**: [Add link here]

### Claim
âœ… Supports healthy aging

### Substantiation
Healthy aging is inherent to the maintenance of various biological systems and processes such as cardiovascular health, collagen production, hair, skin, and nail health, scavenging of free radicals, etc. It may also be extended to compounds that have been shown to decrease with age, and are further associated with positive health outcomes, such as Coenzyme Q10.

### Caveats
Must be in the context of "maintaining," "supporting," "contributing to" healthy aging by means of supporting critical physiological processes that are inextricably linked to aging. Modifiers such as "reduces," "minimizes," "lessens," etc. should not be used to characterize healthy aging claims.

## Claim 5: Microbiome Support
**Link**: [Add link here]

### Claim
âœ… For your Microbiome

### Substantiation
This claim is supported through both the capsule-in-capsule delivery system, which has been verified to dissolve ~3H. following consumption, in addition to preclinical studies that have demonstrated microbiome-modulating effects from select ingredients in DM-02 including several B-vitamins. DM-02 also contains a prebiotic complex comprised of Japanese wasabi root and leaf extract(s) standardized for isothiocyanates and flavonoids, respectively. Both ITC and polyphenols, with flavonoids in particular, exhibit well-elucidated microbiome-modulating effects.

### Caveats
Based on the design principle, this product is intended to deliver nutrients directly to the microbiome (which is intentionally open-ended to include various anatomical regions including the SI). Therefore, it is engineered, designed, targeted, etc. for the microbiome. In the absence of supporting evidence that measures an actual health output of this, however, "For your Microbiome" should be decoupled from structure-function claims (i.e., discussing microbiome modulation, shifts, benefits, etc.).

## Claim 6: Gut Microbiome Delivery
**Link**: [Add link here]

### Claim
âœ… Inner capsule ensures precise delivery of critical nutrients to the gut microbiomeâ€”the foundation of whole body health

### Substantiation
Inner capsule dissolves ~3H. following consumption. This aligns with the PK of the distal ileum/colon which has been shown to be stimulated by the inner-capsule contents of DS-01. Considering the gut microbiome consists of several anatomical regions including the duodenum, jejunum, proximal ileum, distal ileum, ascending colon, etc., the qualifier "gut" is intended to be deliberately broad and capture these possible interactions.

### Caveats
Similar to "For your Microbiome," we want to avoid making any structure-function claims associated with the ingredients themselves without generating additional data. With this, "the foundation of whole body health" is likely the threshold that we want to approach and not exceed as we are not saying that the product will support whole body health, but rather, it was designed to deliver critical nutrients to the microbiome which serves as the foundation of whole body health. While this may be considered an implied claim, the circuitous approach attenuates risk to a degree that is considered to be tenable.
