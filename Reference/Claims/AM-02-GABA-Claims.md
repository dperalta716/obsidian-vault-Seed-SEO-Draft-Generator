### Notes/Caveats
NNHPD cited PharmaGABA study in monograph. While referencing PharmaGABA-specific claims (e.g., improved sleep quality, long-term memory, vitality, skin elasticity, etc.) is considered to be medium-to-high risk, which was previously aligned on following external counsel discussion, the claim presented here does not carry the same magnitude of risk and is considered to be applicable given the review process.
