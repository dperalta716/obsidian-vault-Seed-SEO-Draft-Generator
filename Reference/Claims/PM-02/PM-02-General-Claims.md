https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00018.2018

### Notes/Caveats
Peripheral serotonin does not cross the blood-brain barrier, but serotonin precursors and metabolites can influence CNS function through indirect pathways.

---

## Claim 3: SCFAs Cross Blood-Brain Barrier and Influence Sleep

### Claim
✅ Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by gut bacteria can cross the blood-brain barrier and influence neurotransmitter production related to sleep regulation

### Substantiation
SCFAs, particularly acetate and propionate, can cross the blood-brain barrier and influence brain energy metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, and neurological signaling pathways involved in sleep-wake regulation.

## Claim 5: Circadian Rhythm and Microbiome Synchronization

### Claim
✅ The gut microbiome exhibits circadian rhythms that synchronize with the host's sleep-wake cycle

### Substantiation
Research demonstrates that the gut microbiome composition and metabolic activity follow circadian patterns that align with host feeding and sleeping cycles. Disruption of these rhythms (e.g., shift work, jet lag) can negatively impact both microbiome health and sleep quality.

### Study Link
