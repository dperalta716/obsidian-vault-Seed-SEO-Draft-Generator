## Study 2: Effects of low oral doses of melatonin, given 2-4 hours before habitual bedtime, on sleep in normal young humans
**Link**: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8843534/

### Claims
✅ Physiological dose of melatonin
✅ Mimics nocturnal physiological concentration
✅ Replicates your body's natural amount of melatonin
✅ Bioidentical melatonin
✅ Wake up feeling refreshed/no grogginess

### Design
- **Type**: DBRCT
- **Population**: Healthy young adults
- **Duration**: Acute administration
- **Sample Size**: 12

### Supporting Material
Measurement of melatonin concentrations in the serum of the subjects confirmed that administration of the lower dose (0.3 mg) of the hormone at 2100 hours elevated serum melatonin to levels within the normal nocturnal range (112.6 +/- 13.53 pg/ml) at the time the sleep test was initiated (Fig. 3). Administration of the 1.0-mg dose increased serum melatonin levels to supraphysiologic levels 50 minutes later (521.4 ± 71.25 pg/ml).

Analysis of subjective sleepiness and of reaction times in response to visual or auditory stimuli on the morning following treatment (at 0730 or 0930 hours) revealed no hangover effects from the melatonin treatment (Fig. 4), a finding similar to one that we reported earlier (41).

These data affirm that the induction of physiological concentrations of melatonin 2-4 hours prior to habitual bedtime has a sleep-promoting effect in healthy young males and significantly decreases latencies to sleep onset and to stage 2 sleep.

### Study Dose
0.3mg

### Dose Matched
Yes

### Support for Claim
High

### Notes/Caveats
Dose in PM is slightly higher (0.2mg) than study dose, but does not deviate significantly from serum concentration when extrapolating.

## Study 3: Health Canada Melatonin Monograph
**Link**: https://webprod.hc-sc.gc.ca/nhpid-bdipsn/atReq?atid=melatonin.oral&lang=eng

### Claims
✅ (Used as a) sleep aid (to help promote sleep)
✅ Helps increase the total sleep time (aspect of sleep quality) in people suffering from sleep restriction or altered sleep schedule (e.g. shift-work and jet lag)
✅ Helps (to) speed up/reduce the time it takes to fall asleep (sleep onset latency aspect of sleep quality) in people who fall asleep slowly/with delayed sleep phase disorder
✅ Helps (to) re-set the body's sleep-wake cycle (aspect of the circadian rhythm)

### Design
NNHPD Review

### Supporting Material
See Melatonin Monograph

### Study Dose
0.1–10mg (Jet lag = 0.5-10mg)

### Dose Matched
Yes

### Support for Claim
Not specified

### Notes/Caveats
None specified

## Study 4: EFSA Health Claims
**Link**: https://ec.europa.eu/food/food-feed-portal/screen/health-claims/eu-register/details/POL-HC-6418

### Claims
✅ Melatonin contributes to the alleviation of subjective feelings of jet lag

### Design
EFSA Review

### Supporting Material
See EFSA Health Claims

### Study Dose
0.5mg

### Dose Matched
Yes

### Support for Claim
High

### Notes/Caveats
The claim may be used only for food which contains at least 0.5 mg of melatonin per quantified portion. In order to bear the claim, information shall be given to the consumer that the beneficial effect is obtained with a minimum intake of 0.5 mg to be taken close to bedtime on the first day of travel and on the following few days after arrival at the destination.

## Study 5: Meta-analysis: melatonin for the treatment of primary sleep disorder
**Link**: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23691095/

### Claims
✅ Improves sleep quality
✅ Improves/increases sleep duration
✅ Improved/reduced sleep latency (fall asleep faster)
✅ Promotes restful sleep
✅ Supports the body's natural sleep cycle
✅ Regulates [the body's] circadian rhythm
✅ Safe-dose, drug-free/non-habit forming

### Design
- **Type**: Meta-analysis of efficacy of melatonin for primary sleep disorders
- **Population**: Individuals with sleep disorders
- **Duration**: N/A
- **Sample Size**: 19 studies (N = 1683)

### Supporting Material
Melatonin demonstrated a significant effect in improving sleep quality. Subjects randomly assigned to melatonin had improvements in sleep quality compared to placebo (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.22 [95% CI: 0.12 to 0.32], Z = 4.52, p<0.001).

Melatonin also significantly increased total sleep time compared to placebo. Subjects randomly assigned to melatonin had on average a total sleep time 8 minutes longer than subjects taking placebo (WMD = 8.25 minutes [95% CI: 1.74 to 14.75], Z = 2.48, p = 0.013).

Our meta-analysis demonstrated melatonin had a significant benefit in reducing sleep latency. Subjects randomly assigned to melatonin fell asleep 7 minutes earlier on average than subjects receiving placebo (weighted mean difference (WMD) = 7.06 minutes [95% CI: 4.37 to 9.75], Z = 5.15, p<0.001).

### Study Dose
0.1–5mg

### Dose Matched

### Notes/Caveats

## Study 6: Melatonin treatment for age-related insomnia
**Link**: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11600532/

### Claims
✅ Supports improved/better sleep

### Design
- **Type**: DBRCT
- **Population**: Healthy adults aged >50 years with insomnia or normal sleep patterns
- **Duration**: Seven (7) days
- **Sample Size**: 30

### Supporting Material
The sleep of insomniac subjects was significantly improved by all three melatonin doses, with the 0.3-mg dose causing the greatest effect (P<0.0001) (Fig. 1B and Table 1). This change in overnight sleep efficiency was principally due to increased sleep efficiency during the middle portion of the nocturnal sleep period (P = 0.018) and, secondarily, to improvement during the latter third of the night (Fig. 2). The sleep efficiencies of insomniac subjects were normal during the first third of the night and were unaffected by melatonin during this interval. Melatonin had no behaviorally significant, dose-related effects on total sleep time; number of awakenings; latency to sleep onset; latency to REM sleep; or percent time spent in any of the sleep stages in insomniacs or normal sleepers.

### Study Dose
0.1, 0.3, or 3mg

### Dose Matched
Yes

### Support for Claim
Medium

### Notes/Caveats
No significant increases in sleep efficiency were observed after subjects with normal sleep received any dose of melatonin; results may not translate to general population.
