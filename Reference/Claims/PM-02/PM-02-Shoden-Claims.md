## Study 2: A randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the effects of ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) extract on sleep quality in healthy adults
**Link**: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32540634/

### Claims
✅ Better sleep quality
✅ Improved sleep latency
✅ Fewer sleep disturbances/disruptions
✅ Improved quality of life (physical and psychological)
✅ Supports restorative sleep
✅ Promotes relaxation and calming effect
✅ Positively modulates circadian rhythm (via a reduction in stress/balancing hormones)

### Supporting Material
**Design**: DBRCT
**Population**: Healthy adults
**Duration**: Six (6) weeks
**Sample Size**: 144

The results indicate that ashwagandha extract improved the quality of sleep as compared to placebo. Two-Sample Hotelling's T2 test showed that between the groups in day 8 (before taking intervention) there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) whereas after the intervention (in day 50) there was significant difference between the groups (p < 0.001). There was 72% mean increase in the quality of sleep in ashwagandha group as compared with 29% in the placebo group.

Within the group analysis in ashwagandha group gave very strong evidence that ashwagandha increased the TST (p < 0.001) and SE (p < 0.0001) significantly. There was statistically significant decrease in SOL (p < 0.001), WASO (p < 0.0001) and average awakening time (p < 0.01) in ashwagandha group compared to the corresponding initial period. Between the group analysis indicated that at baseline there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) between ashwagandha and placebo groups in all actigraphy parameters. At the end of the study, the ashwagandha group showed significant increase (p < 0.001) in TST as compared to placebo. The SOL (p < 0.01) and WASO (p < 0.05) in ashwagandha group was significantly less and SE was significantly high (p < 0.01) as compared to placebo group. This data indicates overall significantly better sleep quality in ashwagandha group as compared to placebo.

The ashwagandha group had significant improvement in the domains of physical (p < 0.001), psychological (p < 0.001), and environment (p < 0.01) dimensions. The percentage increase of score between day 8 and day 50 in each domain was better in the treatment group compared to placebo.

Pearson's correlation coefficient indicated that there is a moderate positive correlation in the domains of physical (p < 0.0001; r ¼ 0.67) and psychological (p < 0.0001; r ¼ 0.54) health of WHOQOL-Bref with RSQ-W in ashwagandha group and only a negligible correlation in the domain of physical health of WHOQOLBref with RSQ-W in the placebo group (p < 0.05; r ¼ 0.26).

**Link**: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024129167

### Claims
✅ Promotes a healthy stress response [by balancing cortisol levels]
✅ Supports healthy/balanced cortisol/hormone levels
✅ Supports healthy/balanced testosterone/hormone levels [in men]
✅ Provides relief from day-to-day stress(ors)
✅ Promotes relaxation/mental serenity/calm mind
✅ Improves quality of life [by supporting a healthy stress response]

### Supporting Material
**Design**: DBRCT
**Population**: Healthy adults aged 18–60 years with GAD
**Duration**: 60 days
**Sample Size**: 60

There was a 59% decrease in the HAMA total scores in AE60 and AE120 groups, whereas placebo groups had negligible change (−0.83%) (Table 2). A non-parametric longitudinal factorial analysis to test the intervention and time factors showed that intervention (IP) (p < 0.0001), time (p < 0.0001), and interaction between intervention and time (p < 0.0001), variables all have a statistically significant effect on the outcome variable of anxiety score.

Cortisol stress levels decreased significantly in the AE60 and AE120 groups by 66% and 67%, whereas the placebo had only a 2.22% change. IP (p < 0.0001), time (p < 0.0001), and interaction between IP and time (p < 0.0001) variables all have a statistically significant effect on the outcome variable cortisol.

Testosterone levels showed a 22% and 33% increase in the AE60 and AE120 groups, respectively, whereas in the placebo, there was a 4% increase in males. IP (p = 0.0165), time (p < 0.0001), and interaction between IP and time (p < 0.0001) variables all have a statistically significant effect on the outcome variable Testosterone in males. In females, there was no IP effect seen (p = 0.343), while there is significance in the time factor (p < 0.0001), but the interaction between IP and time was not significant (p = 0.0887).

In the perceived stress scale, the AE60 group had a 53% decrease, the AE120 group had a 62% decrease, whereas placebo had a 5% decrease. IP (p < 0.0001), time (p < 0.0001), and interaction between IP and time (p < 0.0001) variables all have a statistically significant effect on the outcome variable PSS.

In the patient global impression of change the AE60 & AE120 groups reported a 60% change whereas placebo had a 12% decrease. IP (p < 0.0001), time (p < 0.0001), and interaction between IP and time (p < 0.0001) variables all have a statistically significant effect on the outcome variable PGIC.

The clinical global impression of change-severity had a 72% and 68% decrease for the AE60 and AE120 groups, respectively, with a 21% change in placebo. IP (p < 0.0001), time (p < 0.0001), and interaction between IP and time (p < 0.0001) variables all have a statistically significant effect on the outcome variable severity.

### Study Dose
60–120mg

### Dose Matched
Yes

### Support for Claim
Medium

### Notes/Caveats
Individuals who scored high on DSM-IV for generalized anxiety disorder were recruited for the study which may not translate to general population. When discussing stress, it should be framed within the context of occasional frequency and not positioned as a chronic condition (e.g., Supports relief from occasional stress / Provides relief during stressful situations).
