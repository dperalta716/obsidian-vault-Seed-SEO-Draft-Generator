# PM-02 PQQ (20mg) Claims Substantiation

## Study 1: Effects of Oral Supplementation with Pyrroloquinoline Quinone on Stress, Fatigue, and Sleep
**Link**: https://www.ffhdj.com/index.php/ffhd/article/view/81

### Claims
✅ Improved sleep onset and maintenance
✅ Improves sleep quality [a marker of circadian rhythm]
✅ Plays a supporting role in regulating CLOCK proteins/circadian rhythm
✅ Potent antioxidant/reduces oxidative stress
✅ Protects mitochondria from oxidative stress
✅ Stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis
✅ Supports healthy aging [while you sleep]

### Design
- **Type**: Open-label clinical trial
- **Population**: Adults with diagnosed sleep disorder or fatigue
- **Duration**: Eight (8) weeks
- **Sample Size**: 17

### Supporting Material
[Study details not provided in spreadsheet]

### Study Dose
20mg q.d.

### Dose Matched
Yes

### Support for Claim
Medium

### Notes/Caveats
Open-label [pilot] study may introduce participant bias. This effect is attenuated through the use of multiple validated questionnaires and overlapping with biomarker data. Population consisted of Japanese adults with a diagnosed sleep disorder or complaints about fatigue using AIS or POMS-S which may not translate to the general US population. Unable to make any insomnia-related claims due to disease implication.

## Study 2: Pyrroloquinoline quinone disodium salt improves brain function in both younger and older adults
**Link**: https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/fo/d2fo01515c#fn1

### Claims
✅ Brain/cognitive support
✅ Promotes cognitive function
✅ Supports healthy aging [by promoting brain health]

### Design
- **Type**: Double blinded, placebo controlled trial
- **Population**: 41.5 ± 13.7 years
- **Duration**: 12 weeks
- **Sample Size**: 70 adults

### Supporting Material
The cognitive function showed an improvement in score with the administration of PQQ and an overall significant difference in composite memory (P = 0.003) and verbal memory (P = 0.001). Fig. 2 (ESI Fig. S4†) shows the results, along with an age-specific analysis, of this function. In the Old group [41-65 yo], composite memory (P = 0.011) and verbal memory (P = 0.002) improved at 12 weeks of PQQ ingestion. No differences were observed in the Young group [20-40 yo] in terms of verbal memory and composite memory.

There was a significant difference in cognitive flexibility, processing speed, and executive speed in the Young group at 8 weeks.

A score of 1 can be completely determined from the Cognitrax score. The score for all ages was 0.694 at 8 weeks and 0.790 at 12 weeks. The scores improved during the test period. In the Young group, the score reached 1.000 in 8 weeks. In the Old group, the score improved from 0.788 to 1.000 from 8 weeks to 12 weeks.

### Study Dose
20mg q.d.

### Dose Matched
Yes

### Support for Claim
Not specified

### Notes/Caveats
Verbal and composite memory improved only in the elderly cohort.

## Study 3: Dietary pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) alters indicators of inflammation and mitochondrial-related metabolism in human subjects
**Link**: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24231099/

### Claims
✅ [Potent] antioxidant
✅ Free radical protection
✅ Supports mitochondria function
✅ Supports a healthy inflammatory response
✅ Supports healthy aging [by balancing inflammatory markers]

### Design
- **Type**: Crossover; 2 studies
- **Population**: 41.5 ± 13.7 years
- **Duration**: 24h; 76h
- **Sample Size**: 10

### Supporting Material
PQQ exposure (Study 1) resulted in apparent changes in antioxidant potential based on malonaldehyde-related TBAR assessments. In Study 2, PQQ supplementation resulted in significant decreases in the levels of plasma C-reactive protein, IL-6 and urinary methylated amines such as trimethylamine N-oxide, and changes in urinary metabolites consistent with enhanced mitochondria-related functions.

### Study Dose
Study 1: 0.2 mg PQQ/kg single dose; Study 2: 0.3mg PQQ/kg x 3 days

### Dose Matched
Not specified

### Support for Claim
Not specified

### Notes/Caveats
None specified

## Study 4: Effect of the Antioxidant Supplement Pyrroloquinoline Quinone Disodium Salt (BioPQQ™) on Cognitive Functions
**Link**: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4939-3023-4_40

### Claims
✅ Supports healthy aging [by promoting brain health]

### Design
- **Type**: Double blinded, placebo controlled trial
- **Population**: Healthy elderly subjects
- **Duration**: 12 weeks
- **Sample Size**: 41

### Supporting Material
For cognitive functions, selective attention by the Stroop and reverse Stroop test, and visual-spatial cognitive function by the laptop tablet Touch M, were evaluated. In the Stroop test, the change of Stroop interference ratios (SIs) for the PQQ group was significantly smaller than for the placebo group. In the Touch M test, the stratification analyses dividing each group into two groups showed that only in the lower group of the PQQ group (initial score < 70), did the score significantly increase. Measurements of physiological parameters indicated no abnormal blood or urinary adverse events, nor adverse internal or physical examination findings at any point in the study. The preliminary experiment using near-infrared spectrometry (NIRS) suggests that cerebral blood flow in the prefrontal cortex was increased by the administration of PQQ. The results suggest that PQQ can prevent reduction of brain function in aged persons, especially in attention and working memory.

### Study Dose
20mg qd

### Dose Matched
Yes

### Support for Claim
Not specified

### Notes/Caveats
Elderly population; Touch M test results benefitted those with lower baseline scores only.

## Study 5: Effects of Pyrroloquinoline Quinone Disodium Salt Intake on the Serum Cholesterol Levels of Healthy Japanese Adults
**Link**: https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jnsv/61/3/61_233/_article

### Claims
✅ Supports healthy aging [by promoting optimal cardiovascular health]

### Design
- **Type**: Randomized, placebo controlled trial
- **Population**: Healthy Japanese Adults (40-57yo)
- **Duration**: 12 weeks
- **Sample Size**: 29

### Supporting Material
After 12 wk, the mean serum TG levels had not changed; however, a marginally significant decrease in the mean LDL-chol (from 136.1 to 127.0 mg/dL) was observed in the PQQ group. In the stratification analysis of the high LDL-chol subgroup (baseline LDL-chol level ≥ 140 mg/dL), the mean LDL-chol levels decreased significantly from the baseline values in the PQQ group compared to the placebo group. Our study findings suggest that PQQ suppressed the LDL-chol level, which is an important finding, because a high level of this lipid is a risk factor for various lifestyle-related diseases.

### Study Dose
20mg qd

### Dose Matched
Yes

### Support for Claim
Not specified

### Notes/Caveats
Japanese and age-restricted cohort may not universally apply to American market. Marginal improvement in LDL-C overall; effect more profound in those with elevated LDL-C.

## Study 6: Effects of orally administered pyrroloquinoline quinone disodium salt on dry skin conditions in mice and healthy female subjects
**Link**: https://jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jnsv/61/3/61_241/_pdf/-char/ja

### Claims
✅ Supports skin health
✅ Supports healthy aging [by promoting skin health]

### Design
- **Type**: DBRCT
- **Population**: Healthy female adults aged 20–49 years
- **Duration**: Eight (8) weeks
- **Sample Size**: 22

### Supporting Material
[Study details not provided in spreadsheet]

### Study Dose
Not specified

### Dose Matched
Yes

### Support for Claim
Low

### Notes/Caveats
Results are not overly compelling due to small sample size and lack of significance for skin hydration, TEWL on cheek, and viscoelasticity. Sample size is also small. There was, however, significance for TEWL on left forearm, subjective recognition of improvements in wrinkle and pigmentation severity, reduction in mast cells in dermis (mouse model), and CD3+ T-cells in epidermis. With this, it is considered low risk to frame generally as healthy aging or skin health without further expanding.
