# Seed DS-01 vs. Bioma Health Probiotics

**Google Doc:** https://docs.google.com/document/d/12B-xMzpJuvP2yFIQ4R-t9WvJnZeIxEqj2FCQrt5f4Wk/edit

## Gaps Identified

1. **Tributyrin "Postbiotic" Claim** — Bioma includes tributyrin in their formula. While the article doesn't explicitly call it a "postbiotic," clarifying the scientific definition could help readers understand the difference between synthetic compounds and true postbiotics.

## Proposed Addendums

### 1. Understanding Tributyrin's Role

> Bioma includes tributyrin—a synthetic form of butyrate—in their formulation. Butyrate is a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) that plays an important role in colon cell health. What's worth knowing: your gut bacteria naturally produce butyrate when they ferment dietary fiber and prebiotics. This is one reason why live probiotics paired with the right prebiotic fuel can support SCFA production through your body's own metabolic processes.
>
> Some products market tributyrin as a "postbiotic," but it's worth noting that according to the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP), a true postbiotic must be "a preparation of inanimate microorganisms and/or their components." Tributyrin is synthetically produced, not derived from microbial origin—so while it may offer benefits, it doesn't technically meet the scientific definition of a postbiotic. ([Salminen 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41575-021-00440-6))

**Suggested placement:** In the section comparing prebiotic types or when discussing Bioma's ingredient list.

## Notes

- The article focuses more on strain differences (24 vs 3) and prebiotic types (MAPP vs XOS fiber).
- Bioma's tributyrin component is mentioned but not deeply explored—this addendum provides scientific context.
- Maintains neutral tone by explaining both the potential benefits of tributyrin and the definitional nuance.
