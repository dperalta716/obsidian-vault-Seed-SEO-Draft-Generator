# Seed DS-01 vs. Bioma Health Probiotics

**Google Doc:** https://docs.google.com/document/d/12B-xMzpJuvP2yFIQ4R-t9WvJnZeIxEqj2FCQrt5f4Wk/edit

---

## Gaps Identified

1. **Tributyrin Component** — Bioma includes tributyrin in their formula. While the article doesn't explicitly call it a "postbiotic," clarifying the scientific definition could help readers understand the difference between synthetic compounds and true postbiotics.

2. **Why Seed Doesn't Include a Postbiotic** — The article doesn't address why DS-01® doesn't contain tributyrin or a postbiotic component.

## Proposed Addendums

### 1. Understanding Tributyrin's Role

> Bioma includes tributyrin—a synthetic form of butyrate—in their formulation. Butyrate is a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) that plays an important role in colon cell health. What's worth knowing: your gut bacteria naturally produce butyrate when they ferment dietary fiber and prebiotics. This is one reason why live probiotics paired with the right prebiotic fuel can support SCFA production through your body's own metabolic processes.
>
> Some products market tributyrin as a "postbiotic," but it's worth noting that according to the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP), a true postbiotic must be "a preparation of inanimate microorganisms and/or their components." Tributyrin is synthetically produced, not derived from microbial origin—so while it may offer benefits, it doesn't technically meet the scientific definition of a postbiotic. ([Salminen 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41575-021-00440-6))

**Suggested placement:** In the section comparing prebiotic types or when discussing Bioma's ingredient list.

### 2. Does Seed Contain a Postbiotic? Why Doesn't DS-01® Include Tributyrin?

> You might notice that DS-01® doesn't include tributyrin or any postbiotic component. Here's the reasoning behind that choice:
>
> First, postbiotics (and synthetic compounds like tributyrin) are still a relatively new area of study. While they show promise, most research on their safety and benefits has been conducted in cells or animals—not humans. ([Salminen 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41575-021-00440-6)) The clinical evidence base isn't yet as robust as it is for well-characterized probiotic strains with decades of human research.
>
> Second, DS-01®'s live probiotic strains naturally support the production of short-chain fatty acids—including butyrate—through their metabolic activity in the gut. Rather than supplementing with a synthetic form of butyrate, DS-01® supports your body's own SCFA production through live, metabolically active organisms.
>
> Third, postbiotics are often valued for their shelf stability and resistance to digestion. DS-01® addresses these concerns through its patented ViaCap® delivery technology, which has been tested in the Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME®) to deliver viable cells to the colon. In short: DS-01® achieves the survivability benefits that postbiotics promise, while maintaining the full metabolic potential of live organisms.

**Suggested placement:** As a new FAQ question, or in the section comparing the two products' approaches.

## Notes

- The article focuses more on strain differences (24 vs 3) and prebiotic types (MAPP vs XOS fiber).
- Bioma's tributyrin component is mentioned but not deeply explored—these addendums provide scientific context.
- Maintains neutral tone by explaining both the potential benefits of tributyrin and the definitional nuance.
- The "Why no postbiotic?" section draws from Seed's official SciCare POV responses and explains how DS-01® supports SCFA production naturally.
