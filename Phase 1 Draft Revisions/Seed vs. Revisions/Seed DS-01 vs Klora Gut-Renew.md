## Gaps Identified

1. **Tributyrin "Postbiotic" Claim** — Klora markets tributyrin as a "postbiotic," but according to ISAPP's definition, tributyrin (a synthetic chemical) does not meet the scientific criteria for a true postbiotic. The article mentions this but could clarify Seed's scientific position.

## Proposed Addendums

### 1. Tributyrin and the Postbiotic Definition

> A note on terminology: while Klora describes tributyrin as a "postbiotic," it's helpful to understand what that term actually means scientifically. The International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) defines a postbiotic as "a preparation of inanimate microorganisms and/or their components that confers a health benefit on the host." The key phrase here is "microorganisms and/or their components"—meaning true postbiotics must be derived from microbial origin. Tributyrin is a synthetically produced compound, not derived from microorganisms, which means it doesn't technically fit this definition. That doesn't negate any potential benefits tributyrin may offer for gut cell health—but it does mean the "postbiotic" label is more of a marketing term than a scientific classification in this context. ([Salminen 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41575-021-00440-6))

> DS-01®'s approach is different: live probiotic strains naturally produce short-chain fatty acids (including butyrate) through their metabolic activity, supporting gut health through a mechanism that's been studied in clinical trials on the finished product.

**Suggested placement:** In the section explaining what synbiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics are, or when discussing Klora's tributyrin component.

## Notes

- The article already does an excellent job distinguishing between synbiotics (DS-01®) and prebiotic + postbiotic products (Klora).
- The article mentions that "a true postbiotic involves non-living microbes or parts of them, which is important when evaluating claims"—this addendum reinforces that point with the specific ISAPP definition.
- Tone remains educational and neutral, helping readers evaluate product claims rather than making superiority claims.
