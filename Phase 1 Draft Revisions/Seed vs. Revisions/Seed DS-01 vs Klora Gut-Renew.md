# Seed DS-01 vs. Klora Gut-Renew

**Google Doc:** https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Kvwz_JjYx7RBD8w5el39D99BfsyGVQFxoFoWOccqQM/edit

## Gaps Identified

1. **Tributyrin "Postbiotic" Claim** — Klora markets tributyrin as a "postbiotic," but according to ISAPP's definition, tributyrin (a synthetic chemical) does not meet the scientific criteria for a true postbiotic. The article mentions this but could clarify Seed's scientific position.

2. **Why Seed Doesn't Include a Postbiotic** — The article doesn't address why DS-01® doesn't contain a postbiotic component.

## Proposed Addendums

### 1. Tributyrin and the Postbiotic Definition

> A note on terminology: while Klora describes tributyrin as a "postbiotic," it's helpful to understand what that term actually means scientifically. The International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) defines a postbiotic as "a preparation of inanimate microorganisms and/or their components that confers a health benefit on the host." The key phrase here is "microorganisms and/or their components"—meaning true postbiotics must be derived from microbial origin. Tributyrin is synthetically produced, not derived from microorganisms, which means it doesn't technically fit this definition. ([Salminen 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41575-021-00440-6)) That doesn't negate any potential benefits tributyrin may offer for gut cell health—but it does mean the "postbiotic" label is more of a marketing term than a scientific classification in this context.

**Suggested placement:** In the section explaining what synbiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics are, or when discussing Klora's tributyrin component.

### 2. Does Seed Contain a Postbiotic? Why Doesn't DS-01® Include One?

> Since Klora includes a postbiotic (or at least markets tributyrin as one), you might wonder why DS-01® doesn't. Here's Seed's reasoning:
>
> Postbiotics are still a relatively new area of study. While they show promise for gut health and immunity, most research on their safety and benefits has been conducted in cells or animals—not humans. ([Salminen 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41575-021-00440-6)) The clinical evidence base isn't yet as robust as it is for well-characterized probiotic strains.
>
> Additionally, postbiotics are often valued for their shelf stability and resistance to digestion—challenges that DS-01® addresses through its patented ViaCap® delivery technology. When tested in the Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME®), ViaCap® was able to withstand stomach acid and deliver viable cells to the colon. DS-01® achieves the survivability benefits that postbiotics promise, while maintaining the full metabolic potential of live organisms.
>
> Finally, a postbiotic isn't required for probiotics to confer their intended health benefits. DS-01® includes 24 live probiotic strains—each selected based on robust clinical evidence—that support gastrointestinal function, gut barrier integrity, cardiovascular health, and more. Live probiotics can also naturally support the production of short-chain fatty acids (including butyrate) through their metabolic activity in the gut.

**Suggested placement:** As a new FAQ question, or in the section comparing the two products' approaches.

## Notes

- The article already does an excellent job distinguishing between synbiotics (DS-01®) and prebiotic + postbiotic products (Klora).
- The article mentions that "a true postbiotic involves non-living microbes or parts of them, which is important when evaluating claims"—these addendums reinforce that point with the specific ISAPP definition.
- Tone remains educational and neutral, helping readers evaluate product claims rather than making superiority claims.
- The "Why no postbiotic?" section draws from Seed's official SciCare POV responses.
