## Gaps Identified

1. **Why Seed Chose Lactobacillus/Bifidobacterium Over Spore-Based** — The article explains the difference between spore-based (Bacillus) and traditional probiotics, but could add more on Seed's specific scientific reasoning for choosing Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera.

## Proposed Addendums

### 1. Seed's Rationale for Strain Selection

> Why does DS-01® focus exclusively on *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium* genera rather than including spore-based *Bacillus* strains? It comes down to research depth and safety records. "We focused primarily on human-derived strains with a robust body of mechanistic and clinical evidence that were expected to have benefits for the average healthy adult," explains Dirk Gevers, Ph.D., Seed's Chief Scientific Officer.
>
> *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium* genera have decades of clinical research behind them, extensive safety records across diverse populations, and well-documented mechanisms of action. While *Bacillus* strains offer impressive natural durability (those protective endospores can survive harsh conditions without special delivery technology), the depth of strain-specific research linking them to systemic health benefits is still catching up to their traditional probiotic counterparts. Neither approach is inherently "better"—they simply represent different scientific philosophies.

**Suggested placement:** In the section discussing DS-01®'s strain selection, or after explaining Just Thrive's spore-based approach.

## Notes

- The article already does a good job explaining the differences between spore-based and traditional probiotics.
- This addendum provides Seed's reasoning without disparaging the spore-based approach.
- Per Seed's SciCare POV: "our product includes solely probiotic strains from the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera with a long history of research, extensive safety records, and long-term microbiome stability data."
