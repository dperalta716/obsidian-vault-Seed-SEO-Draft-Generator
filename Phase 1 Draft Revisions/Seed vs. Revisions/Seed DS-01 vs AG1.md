## Gaps Identified

**No significant gaps identified.**

The article comprehensively addresses that AG1 and DS-01® are fundamentally different product categories:
- AG1 is a "foundational nutrition supplement" / greens powder (83 ingredients including vitamins, minerals, adaptogens, digestive enzymes, plus some probiotics)
- DS-01® is a specialized synbiotic focused on microbial health

## Review Notes

The article effectively covers:

1. **Product Category Distinction** — Clearly explains "DS-01® goes deep while AG1 goes wide" and frames the comparison as "telescope vs Swiss Army knife"

2. **AG1's Additional Ingredients** — Addresses vitamins, minerals, adaptogens, digestive enzymes, superfoods, and why AG1 includes these (general wellness, closing nutrient gaps) vs. DS-01®'s focused approach

3. **Probiotic Differences** — AG1's 5 strains / 10B CFU vs DS-01®'s 24 strains / 53.6B AFU

4. **Prebiotic Differences** — AG1's inulin vs DS-01®'s MAPP™ pomegranate prebiotic

5. **Delivery Systems** — Powder vs ViaCap® capsule technology

6. **Scientific Backing** — Both have survivability testing; DS-01® emphasizes finished-product clinical trials
