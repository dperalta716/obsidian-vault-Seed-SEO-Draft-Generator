## Gaps Identified

1. **Akkermansia muciniphila** — Pendulum prominently features *Akkermansia muciniphila* in their products. While the article discusses this difference, it could benefit from Seed's scientific perspective on why they chose not to include Akkermansia and how their Lactobacillus/Bifidobacterium strains may indirectly support Akkermansia abundance.

## Proposed Addendums

### 1. Seed's Approach to Akkermansia

> If you're intrigued by *Akkermansia muciniphila*, it's worth understanding both its promise and its practical challenges. Akkermansia is a strict anaerobe—meaning it requires a completely oxygen-free environment to culture—which presents significant formulation challenges. Additionally, while research shows promising associations between Akkermansia abundance and metabolic health markers, some controversies exist regarding its effects on conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). One study observed that the same *A. muciniphila* strain that alleviated colitis in some mice actually aggravated gut inflammation in mice infected with certain pathogens. ([He 2024](https://doi.org/10.3390/foods14010023))
>
> Interestingly, preliminary research suggests your gut's native Akkermansia population may be supported through other means. One human study found that healthy volunteers who took *Lactobacillus rhamnosus* and *Bifidobacterium longum* BB536—a strain also found in DS-01®—showed increased *A. muciniphila* abundance after the supplementation period. ([Toscano 2017](https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v23.i15.2696)) The proposed mechanism: these strains increase short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, which promotes mucin growth in the gut lining. Since *A. muciniphila* thrives on mucin, this may create a more hospitable environment for native Akkermansia. That said, more research is needed before drawing firm conclusions about using traditional probiotics to reliably increase Akkermansia levels.

**Suggested placement:** In the section comparing strain compositions, after discussing Pendulum's novel anaerobic strains including Akkermansia.

### 2. Why Seed Focuses on Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium

> DS-01® includes solely probiotic strains from the *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium* genera—and there's a deliberate reason for this. These genera have a long history of research, extensive safety records, and long-term microbiome stability data across diverse populations. As microbiome scientist Dirk Gevers, Ph.D., notes: "We focused primarily on human-derived strains with a robust body of mechanistic and clinical evidence that were expected to have benefits for the average healthy adult." While novel organisms like Akkermansia show promise for specific conditions, the depth of clinical evidence for Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains remains unparalleled for broad, systemic health support.

**Suggested placement:** In the DS-01® strain diversity section, to provide context for why Seed chose these genera.

## Notes

- The article already does a good job positioning Pendulum as "specialized" for specific conditions (blood sugar, gut lining) vs. DS-01® for "broad, daily support."
- These addendums provide additional scientific context without claiming superiority—they explain Seed's reasoning while acknowledging Akkermansia's potential.
- Per Seed's SciCare POV: "typical probiotics on the market today rarely contain this species despite its natural abundance, due to several logistical challenges in culturing it."
- Language is tempered to align with Seed's SciCare guidance that they "wouldn't advise using our product...as a reliable way to increase natural abundance levels of this microbe."
