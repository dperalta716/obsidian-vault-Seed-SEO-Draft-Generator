## Gaps Identified

1. **Tributyrin "Postbiotic" Claim** — Ritual markets tributyrin as a "postbiotic," but according to ISAPP's definition, tributyrin (a synthetic chemical) does not qualify as a true postbiotic. The article mentions Ritual's postbiotic but doesn't clarify Seed's scientific position on this terminology.

## Proposed Addendums

### 1. Tributyrin and the Postbiotic Definition

> It's worth noting that while Ritual markets tributyrin as a "postbiotic," this terminology deserves some scientific context. According to the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP), a true postbiotic must be "a preparation of inanimate microorganisms and/or their components that confers a health benefit on the host." Tributyrin is a synthetically derived compound—not derived from microbial origin—which means it doesn't technically meet the scientific definition of a postbiotic. That's not to say tributyrin lacks potential benefits, but understanding the distinction helps you evaluate product claims more accurately. DS-01®'s live probiotic strains naturally support the production of short-chain fatty acids (including butyrate) through their metabolic activity in the gut—achieving similar outcomes through a different, research-backed mechanism. ([Salminen 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41575-021-00440-6))

**Suggested placement:** In the section discussing Ritual's "3-in-1" formula and postbiotic component, after explaining what tributyrin is.

## Notes

- The article does mention that tributyrin is "a synthetically derived ingredient" but doesn't connect this to the ISAPP definition or explain why this matters scientifically.
- The addendum maintains a neutral, factual tone without claiming Seed is superior—it simply provides scientific context.
- This aligns with Seed's SciCare POV documentation which states: "A product which claims a synthetic chemical is a 'postbiotic' simply because it helps the downstream production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) isn't following the actual definition of a postbiotic."
