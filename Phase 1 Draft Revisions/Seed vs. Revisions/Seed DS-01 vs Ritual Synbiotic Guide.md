# Seed DS-01 vs. Ritual Synbiotic+

## Gaps Identified

1. **Tributyrin "Postbiotic" Claim** — Ritual markets tributyrin as a "postbiotic," but according to ISAPP's definition, tributyrin (a synthetic chemical) does not qualify as a true postbiotic. The article mentions Ritual's postbiotic but doesn't clarify Seed's scientific position on this terminology.

2. **Why Seed Doesn't Include a Postbiotic** — The article doesn't address why DS-01® doesn't contain a postbiotic component like Ritual does.

## Proposed Addendums

### 1. Tributyrin and the Postbiotic Definition

> It's worth noting that while Ritual markets tributyrin as a "postbiotic," this terminology deserves some scientific context. According to the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP), a true postbiotic must be "a preparation of inanimate microorganisms and/or their components that confers a health benefit on the host." Tributyrin is a synthetically derived compound—not derived from microbial origin—which means it doesn't technically meet the scientific definition of a postbiotic. ([Salminen 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41575-021-00440-6)) That's not to say tributyrin lacks potential benefits, but understanding the distinction helps you evaluate product claims more accurately.

**Suggested placement:** In the section discussing Ritual's "3-in-1" formula and postbiotic component, after explaining what tributyrin is.

### 2. Does Seed Contain a Postbiotic? Why Doesn't DS-01® Include One?

> You might wonder: if postbiotics are beneficial, why doesn't DS-01® include one? Here's the thinking behind Seed's approach.
>
> First, postbiotics are still a relatively new area of study. While they show promise for gut health and immunity, most research on their safety and benefits has been conducted in cells or animals—not humans. ([Salminen 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41575-021-00440-6)) The clinical evidence base for postbiotics simply isn't as robust as it is for well-characterized probiotic strains.
>
> Second, DS-01® was designed to address the very challenges that postbiotics are often meant to solve. Postbiotics offer more shelf stability and resistance to digestion than some live probiotics—but Seed's patented ViaCap® delivery technology already addresses these concerns. When tested in the Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME®), ViaCap® was able to withstand stomach acid and enable precision delivery of viable cells to the colon. In short: DS-01® achieves the survivability that postbiotics promise, while delivering the full metabolic potential of live organisms.
>
> Third, DS-01® includes 24 live probiotic strains from the *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium* genera—each selected based on robust clinical evidence for the average healthy adult. These strains have been studied to support gastrointestinal function, gut barrier integrity, cardiovascular health, gut immune function, micronutrient synthesis, and dermatological health. A postbiotic isn't required for these strains to deliver their intended benefits.

**Suggested placement:** As a new FAQ question, or in the section comparing the two products' approaches.

## Notes

- The article does mention that tributyrin is "a synthetically derived ingredient" but doesn't connect this to the ISAPP definition or explain why this matters scientifically.
- The addendums maintain a neutral, factual tone without claiming Seed is superior—they simply provide scientific context.
- This aligns with Seed's SciCare POV documentation which states: "A product which claims a synthetic chemical is a 'postbiotic' simply because it helps the downstream production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) isn't following the actual definition of a postbiotic."
- The "Why no postbiotic?" section draws from Seed's official SciCare POV responses.
