# Seed DS-01 vs. The Nue Co. Pre + Probiotic

**Google Doc:** https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qSAZhB3VsYNrMLyRz4YSct12Z3McuEgQZ7DIKbyDDXc/edit

---

## Gaps Identified

**No significant gaps identified.**

The article thoroughly addresses the differences between DS-01®'s multi-strain approach and Nue Co.'s single-strain spore-based approach.

---

## Review Notes

The article effectively covers:

1. **Strain Philosophy** — DS-01®'s 24 diverse strains from Lactobacillus/Bifidobacterium vs. Nue Co.'s single *Bacillus coagulans* strain

2. **Potency Measurement** — AFU (Active Fluorescent Units) vs. CFU (Colony Forming Units) and why Seed uses AFU

3. **Prebiotic Differences** — Non-fermenting MAPP™ pomegranate prebiotic vs. fermentable inulin fiber

4. **Research Approach** — DS-01® emphasizes finished-product clinical trials; Nue Co. relies on existing single-strain research

5. **Delivery Systems** — ViaCap® technology vs. natural spore durability

6. **Strain Specificity** — Dr. Gevers quote explaining that probiotic benefits are strain-specific, not universal

## Proposed Addendums

None required. The article comprehensively addresses the differences between multi-strain synbiotic and single-strain spore-based approaches.

## Optional Enhancement

If desired, could add a brief note on why Seed specifically chose Lactobacillus/Bifidobacterium genera (long research history, extensive safety records, human-derived strains), though this is largely implied in the existing content.
