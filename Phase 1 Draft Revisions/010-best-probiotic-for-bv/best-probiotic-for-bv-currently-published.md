## Article Content Summary (from search results)

### What is Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)?

In a healthy state, your vaginal microbiome is dominated by bacteria mainly from the Lactobacillus genus, whose main job is to keep things in balance by producing lactic acid and keeping the vaginal environment comfortably acidic.

Bacterial vaginosis happens when that balance is disrupted. Instead of being dominated by peacekeepers, the microbiome shifts—and bacteria like Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae start to multiply, pushing out the protective lactobacilli.

### The Role of Probiotics

Certain probiotic strains, especially from the species Lactobacillus crispatus, can help support a stable, healthy vaginal environment by encouraging a lower pH and discouraging disruptive bacteria.

A major meta-analysis found probiotics are most helpful as an adjunct—meaning, in combination with antibiotics or as a follow-up strategy. Effects may include immune support, beneficial pH changes, competition with BV bacteria, and, most importantly, restoring a vaginal flora dominated by lactobacilli.

### Key Probiotic Strains

When it comes to bacterial vaginosis, different lactobacilli don't play the same role. It's not about any random "women's probiotic"—it's about the right species, strains, and delivery system.

Lactobacillus crispatus is considered the hardest working species for vaginal health. Studies show that vaginal microbiomes dominated by L. crispatus are more stable, more acidic, and less prone to BV recurrence.

### Oral vs. Vaginal Probiotics

If you want to act fast after antibiotics, vaginal probiotics are the direct approach. For longer-term support or prevention, oral probiotics—when you choose clinically-studied strains—can be a smart addition to your routine.

VS-01™ tablets have been intentionally designed as a vaginal suppository, not an oral capsule or pill. That's because there is no direct route for oral probiotics to positively impact or modify the vaginal microbiome.

### Seed's VS-01™ Product

The VS-01™ is the first vaginal probiotic suppository clinically validated to establish an optimal vaginal microbiome dominated by L. crispatus—the vagina's most protective bacteria.

In their first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, VS-01™ converted 90% of participants to an optimal vaginal microbiome within 21 days and was superior to both a leading oral probiotic for vaginal health and placebo.

### Key Takeaways

Probiotics for bacterial vaginosis aren't a cure-all, but they're a promising tool for supporting balance and reducing frustrating recurrences. They work best as part of a thoughtful plan—used alongside and after antibiotics, with the right strains at the right dose.

Whatever you do, don't take treatment into your own hands. There is no evidence to show that DIY remedies like yogurt-soaked tampons help cure BV—and they might make things worse. Consult your doctor to find a solution that works for you.
