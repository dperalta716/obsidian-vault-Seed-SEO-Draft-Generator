# Metagenics vs Pure Encapsulations vs Seed DM-02™: A Detailed Review

### Overview
*   **Seed DM-02™:** A 2-in-1 multivitamin and prebiotic formulated for both whole-body health and the gut microbiome, featuring a unique capsule-in-capsule delivery system.
*   **Metagenics PhytoMulti®:** A phytonutrient-dense formula focusing on plant extracts for cellular health, delivered in a standard tablet format.
*   **Pure Encapsulations O.N.E.™:** A simplified, hypoallergenic one-a-day capsule focusing on essential nutrients and basic antioxidant support.
*   **Key Difference:** While all three prioritize bioavailable ingredients, only DM-02™ incorporates specific technology to deliver nutrients to the microbiome and includes a complete Cellular Energy Complex (CoQ10, PQQ, Spermidine).

Choosing a multivitamin used to be simple—or at least, it felt that way. You’d walk into a store, grab the bottle with the most impressive-looking label, and hope for the best. But today, if you’re looking at brands like Metagenics, Pure Encapsulations, or Seed, you’ve likely graduated from the basic grocery store options. You’re looking for something that actually works.

The problem is, "working" means different things to different people. Are you looking for a massive dose of plant extracts? A simple, hypoallergenic safety net? Or are you interested in the new frontier of nutrition science that connects your vitamin intake to your gut health?

We’re going to break down three of the most scientifically grounded options on the market: Metagenics PhytoMulti®, Pure Encapsulations O.N.E.™, and Seed’s DM-02™ Daily Multivitamin. We’ll look past the marketing and dive into the delivery technologies, nutrient forms, and scientific philosophies that set them apart.

## What Makes a Multivitamin Actually Work?

Before we compare the bottles, let’s agree on the criteria. Most of us take a multivitamin for "insurance," but if your body can't use what's inside the capsule, that insurance policy isn't worth much. Here are the three factors that actually matter:

**Bioavailability**
You’ll see this word a lot, but here’s the simple version: It’s not about what you eat; it’s about what you absorb. Many standard multivitamins use "inactive" forms of vitamins (like folic acid) because they are cheaper and more stable. The catch? Your body has to do the heavy lifting to convert them into "active" forms (like methylfolate) before they can be used. For many people, genetic variations make this conversion inefficient, meaning those nutrients just pass right through you.

**Delivery**
Where nutrients end up matters just as much as what they are. It’s not just about a pill dissolving in your stomach acid (which can actually destroy certain delicate compounds). Advanced delivery systems ensure nutrients survive digestion and reach the specific part of your GI tract where they can be absorbed most effectively.

**The Microbiome Paradigm Shift**
This is the newest and perhaps most critical piece of the puzzle. We used to think nutrition was just about feeding your human cells. But new science suggests nutrition is a two-way street. Your gut bacteria actually produce certain B vitamins and vitamin K themselves, but they need the right "fuel" to do so ([Magnúsdóttir 2015](https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2015.00148)). A truly effective multivitamin doesn't just bypass the gut—it considers the entire ecosystem.

## A Closer Look: Seed's DM-02™ Daily Multivitamin

### The 2-in-1 Difference: Nutrients for You and Your Microbiome
Seed has built its reputation on microbiome science, so it’s no surprise that their multivitamin, DM-02™, approaches nutrition differently. It acts as a 2-in-1 formula. It’s designed to support your systemic health (immune function, heart health, skin) while simultaneously providing specific nutrients to the gut microbiome.

### Key DM-02™ Benefits: What the Science Shows
DM-02™ is formulated to cover your bases without overloading your system. It provides 100% of the Daily Value for 20 essential vitamins and minerals. The philosophy here is "precision dosing"—giving your body exactly what it needs to complement a healthy diet, rather than hitting you with mega-doses that your body often just excretes.

### Bioavailable Forms: Nutrients Your Body Can Actually Use
Seed uses the active, body-ready forms of nutrients. This includes methylated B vitamins (like 5-MTHF folate instead of folic acid), chelated minerals (which are easier to absorb), and Vitamin D3.

But here is the fascinating part: using bioavailable micronutrients doesn't just help you. Research indicates that the form of micronutrients you consume can actively shape the composition of your gut microbiome ([Scarpellini 2021](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19010037)). By using forms your body and bacteria recognize, DM-02™ supports that delicate ecosystem.

### The Cellular Energy Complex: CoQ10, PQQ, and Spermidine
This is where DM-02™ steps away from the pack. In addition to essential vitamins, it includes a Cellular Energy Complex containing CoQ10, PQQ, and Spermidine.
*   **CoQ10** is critical for mitochondrial function, but our natural levels decline as we age ([Barcelos 2019](https://doi.org/10.3390/biology8020028)).
*   **PQQ** is a powerful compound shown to support mitochondrial biogenesis—essentially helping your cells build new energy power plants ([Chowanadisai 2010](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M109.030130)).
*   **Spermidine** is included for its role in supporting cellular renewal.

### The Delivery System: ViaCap® Technology
Seed uses a proprietary "Cap-in-Cap" technology called ViaCap®.
*   **The Outer Capsule** contains essential vitamins and minerals in liquid and powder forms, releasing them in the upper GI tract for absorption.
*   **The Inner Capsule** is suspended inside. It survives the stomach and delivers specific nutrients and prebiotics (like Japanese wasabi) directly to the colon.

### Microbiome Support: The Gut-Nutrition Connection
We often forget that our gut microbes have their own nutritional needs—and the science is showing us just how much that matters. The inner capsule of DM-02™ delivers specific B vitamins and prebiotics to the lower gut. This supports the bacteria that are responsible for synthesizing their own vitamins, creating a positive feedback loop for your health.

## A Closer Look: Metagenics PhytoMulti®

### Formulation Overview
Metagenics is a well-respected brand in the practitioner channel (meaning doctors often recommend it). Their flagship product, PhytoMulti®, positions itself as a "smart multi" that goes beyond basic vitamins and minerals.

### Key Ingredients and Forms
PhytoMulti® generally uses high-quality forms of vitamins, such as methylated folate (L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate) and methylcobalamin (B12). It provides a solid baseline of essential nutrients, typically adhering to high-potency standards found in practitioner-grade supplements.

### Benefit Claims
The main differentiator for PhytoMulti® is its "proprietary phytonutrient blend." This includes extracts from 13 different plants, such as green tea, pomegranate, and grape seed. The idea is to provide the "cellular protection" and antioxidant support you’d get from a diverse, plant-rich diet. Metagenics claims this blend supports DNA stability and overall cellular health.

### Delivery Format
PhytoMulti® comes in a standard tablet format. While effective for many, tablets can sometimes be harder to break down than capsules, depending on an individual's digestion.

### Considerations
To get the full serving, you need to take **two tablets daily**. It is a robust formula, but it focuses heavily on plant extracts rather than specific mitochondrial compounds like PQQ or targeted microbiome delivery technologies.

## A Closer Look: Pure Encapsulations O.N.E.™

### Formulation Overview
Pure Encapsulations is famous for what they *don't* put in their products. O.N.E.™ Multivitamin is a hypoallergenic, "free-from" formula designed for people with sensitivities. It’s a straightforward, high-quality multivitamin.

### Key Ingredients and Forms
True to its reputation, O.N.E.™ uses excellent nutrient forms. It features Metafolin® (a patented form of methylfolate) and activated B vitamins (like Riboflavin 5' phosphate). It also includes a sustained-release CoQ10, which is a nice bonus for a basic multi, though it lacks the broader cellular complex found in DM-02™.

### Benefit Claims
The primary claim here is simplicity and purity. It covers the essentials for antioxidant support, eye health (via Lutein and Zeaxanthin), and cellular function without any fillers, gluten, or common allergens.

### Delivery Format
As the name suggests, this is a **one-a-day capsule**. For people who hate swallowing pills or want the absolute simplest routine, this is a strong selling point.

### Considerations
While O.N.E.™ is excellent for sensitive individuals, it is a more "traditional" multivitamin. It doesn't include specific prebiotics or technology designed to deliver nutrients to the microbiome. It’s a great safety net, but it’s less of a comprehensive system than DM-02™.

## What Does This Mean For You? Choosing the Right Multivitamin

Deciding between these three comes down to your specific health philosophy and lifestyle needs.

**Choose Metagenics PhytoMulti® if:**
You feel your diet is lacking in fruits and vegetables and you want a supplement that doubles as a "greens" blend. If you are comfortable taking two tablets a day and prioritize plant extracts over specific microbiome support, this is a solid practitioner-grade option.

**Choose Pure Encapsulations O.N.E.™ if:**
You have severe allergies or sensitivities and need a strictly hypoallergenic formula. It’s also the right choice if you are on a tighter budget and want a high-quality, no-frills "insurance policy" that requires just one pill a day.

**Choose Seed DM-02™ if:**
You view health through a systemic lens. If you understand that gut health is linked to everything from energy to immunity, DM-02™ offers a comprehensive solution. It’s the best choice if you want precision dosing (no mega-doses), specific support for mitochondrial energy (CoQ10 + PQQ), and a delivery system designed to nourish both you and your microbiome.

## The Key Insight
The multivitamin category hasn't changed much in decades—until now. While Metagenics and Pure Encapsulations offer high-quality versions of the traditional multivitamin, Seed’s DM-02™ represents a shift in thinking. By acknowledging that our gut bacteria are active participants in our nutrition—and that they need specific nutrients delivered to the right place to function—DM-02™ transforms a daily habit into a dual-action tool for systemic health. It’s not just about preventing deficiencies; it’s about fueling the biological partnership between you and your microbiome.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why do some multivitamins require 2 or more pills per day?**
Multivitamins often require multiple pills because effective doses of minerals (like magnesium and calcium) and bulky plant extracts take up physical space. Metagenics PhytoMulti® requires two tablets to fit its phytonutrient blend. Seed’s DM-02™ and Pure Encapsulations O.N.E.™ are formulated to fit into a single daily capsule by prioritizing high-potency micronutrients and precision dosing rather than bulky fillers or macro-minerals you likely get from food.

**Can I take these multivitamins on an empty stomach?**
While some people can tolerate vitamins without food, it is generally recommended to take any multivitamin with a meal. This is especially true for fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) and compounds like CoQ10 found in Seed DM-02™ and Pure Encapsulations O.N.E.™, which absorb better when consumed with dietary fat.

**Are these products vegan?**
Seed DM-02™ is vegan. Pure Encapsulations O.N.E.™ is vegetarian and typically suitable for vegans (though you should always check the specific bottle for coating details). Metagenics PhytoMulti® is generally vegetarian, but users should verify specific formulations as coating ingredients can vary.
