## 6. Synthesis for Drafting

### Competitive Baseline Summary:

Competitive articles are highly evidence-based, ranging from 1100-2200 words, with medical authority sites (Healthline, MNT) providing 15+ academic citations while commercial sites provide 5-10. All articles organize content around specific supplement types with dedicated sections for each nutrient or compound.

The most authoritative articles include specific dosages from clinical trials (e.g., 2.5-10g collagen, 100-200mg hyaluronic acid, 600 IU vitamin D) and emphasize the internal/nutritional approach over topical treatments alone. Content flows from explaining mechanisms of action (skin barrier function, inflammation reduction, collagen production) to practical supplement recommendations with dosage guidance.

Medical authority sites use academic citation styles with PubMed/PMC links and DOIs, while maintaining accessible language for general audiences. Commercial sites tend toward shorter formats with fewer citations but more product-specific recommendations.

### Gaps & Opportunities for Seed:

- **Gap 1**: No article deeply covers the gut-skin axis beyond brief probiotic mentions - opportunity for microbiome-focused angle
- **Gap 2**: Limited coverage of bioavailability differences between supplement forms (e.g., hydrolyzed vs non-hydrolyzed collagen)
- **Gap 3**: No discussion of synergistic effects when combining supplements (e.g., vitamin C + collagen)
- **Gap 4**: Missing coverage of ceramide supplements despite their proven efficacy for skin barrier
- **Gap 5**: Little mention of timing/dosage optimization (when to take supplements for maximum absorption)
- **Opportunity 1**: Root cause approach: nutrient deficiencies vs symptom management
- **Opportunity 2**: No articles discuss precision or bioidentical dosing approaches
- **Opportunity 3**: Minimal coverage of selenium as dry skin solution despite evidence

### Recommended Approach:

1. **Meet baseline** by covering: Collagen, omega-3s, vitamin D, vitamin C, vitamin E, hyaluronic acid, zinc, probiotics (with specific strain focus)

2. **Layer Seed perspective** via:
   - Microbiome connection to skin health (gut-skin axis)
   - Bioavailable forms and precision dosing
   - Nutrient synergies and optimal combinations
   - Root cause approach vs surface-level symptom treatment

3. **Target word count**: 1600-1800 words (baseline articles range: 1100-2200)

4. **Citation strategy**: Based on competitive patterns - aim for 12-15 academic sources with emphasis on recent systematic reviews and clinical trials. Use inline hyperlinked citations in (Author Year) format.

## Notes for Drafter

- Collagen studies (especially Choi 2019 review) are cited most frequently - this is a must-cover topic with strong evidence
- Probiotics are mentioned in 3/5 articles but coverage is shallow - big opportunity for Seed's microbiome expertise
- The omega-3/omega-6 imbalance angle appears in evidence-based articles - consider incorporating for differentiation
- Ceramides and glycosylceramides have strong evidence (Venkataramana 2020) but low competitor coverage - potential unique angle
- Check Seed's DM-02 claims for zinc, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin C since these are core to the topic
- Consider whether any Seed products contain probiotics relevant to skin health (gut-skin axis angle)
- Avoid being too product-focused - lead with ingredient science and mechanisms
- Include specific dosages from clinical trials to establish authority
- Address the "why topicals aren't enough" angle that resonates across competitor content
