## 6. Synthesis for Drafting

### Competitive Baseline Summary:

Competitive articles are comprehensive (1300-2400 words), vitamin-by-vitamin structured pieces that heavily emphasize antioxidant mechanisms protecting against AMD and cataracts. They balance scientific evidence (citing AREDS trials and observational studies) with practical food source recommendations presented in lists or tables.

The tone is educational but accessible, consistently emphasizing whole food sources over supplements while acknowledging AREDS-2 formulations for those with existing macular degeneration. Articles follow a formulaic structure: introduce the vitamin, explain its mechanism (often antioxidant-related), cite clinical evidence for disease prevention (primarily AMD and cataracts), and provide food source lists.

**Word count range**: 600-2400 words (average: 1620 words)

### Gaps & Opportunities for Seed:

- **Gap 1**: Limited discussion of microbiome connection to eye health - no competitor mentions this angle
- **Gap 2**: No articles challenge the 'standard advice' on vitamin megadosing - opportunity to discuss precision dosing philosophy
- **Gap 3**: Minimal coverage of bioavailability and nutrient form (e.g., synthetic vs natural, absorption factors)
- **Gap 4**: Expert physician quotes are rare (only Hopkins features MD quote) - opportunity for Seed to include Dr. Gevers perspective
- **Gap 5**: Articles don't address cross-product ingredients or multi-functional benefits of single nutrients
- **Gap 6**: No discussion of circadian rhythm support or mitochondrial health in relation to eye vitamins
- **Gap 7**: Limited coverage of inflammation beyond omega-3s - opportunity to discuss anti-inflammatory formulation strategy
- **Gap 8**: Heavy focus on disease prevention, less on performance/optimization angle (visual clarity, night vision optimization)
- **Gap 9**: Selenium and lesser-known nutrients receive light treatment - opportunity to go deeper on emerging research

### Recommended Approach:

1. **Meet baseline** by covering: Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Lutein/Zeaxanthin, Zinc, Omega-3s, B Vitamins, AMD/cataract prevention, food sources
2. **Layer Seed perspective** via: Microbiome-eye axis connection, precision dosing vs megadosing, bioavailable forms, mitochondrial support, cross-product ingredient synergies
3. **Target word count**: 1800-2000 words (baseline articles range: 600-2400)
4. **Citation strategy**: Based on competitive patterns - aim for ~12-15 academic sources, prioritize AREDS trials and meta-analyses

## Notes for Drafter

- **AREDS/AREDS2 trials are non-negotiable**: These appear in 4/5 articles and are the gold standard evidence users expect to see
- **Antioxidant mechanism is the dominant narrative**: Every competitor emphasizes free radical protection and oxidative stress reduction
- **Food-first messaging**: All articles recommend diet over supplements, except for people with existing AMD
- **Practical accessibility**: Users want to know "what foods should I eat?" - comprehensive food tables/lists are expected
- **Multi-functional benefits**: Consider how vitamins like lutein might appear in multiple Seed products (if applicable) and address different use cases
- **Vitamin A safety**: GoodRx mentions beta carotene/smoking risk - address safety considerations
- **Expert credibility**: Only Hopkins uses physician quote - this is an opportunity for Dr. Gevers to differentiate
- **PAA questions reveal symptom-based search**: One selected PAA addresses "blurry vision from deficiency" - users are connecting symptoms to potential vitamin deficiencies
- **Selenium opportunity**: Multiple articles mention selenium but give it light treatment - potential differentiation point if relevant to Seed products
