## Complete Workflow Instructions

When the user provides a keyword, execute ALL of the following steps:

### Step 1: Search & Initial Analysis

1. **Web Search**: Perform a web search for the top 5-7 ranking articles for the keyword
2. **Analyze Competition**: Understand common topics covered, angles taken, and standard advice given
3. **Identify Standard Advice**: Note 2-3 pieces of "standard advice" or common assumptions found in top results 
   - Example: "Take 5-10mg of melatonin for sleep"
4. **Capture PAA Questions**: Note down 3-4 relevant "People Also Ask" questions from Google search results page
   - These will be used for the FAQ section later

### Step 2: Determine User Intent & Core Questions

1. Based on Step 1, determine the primary user search intent(s) behind the keyword
2. Identify the core questions users are trying to answer when searching for this keyword
3. What information are they *really* seeking?

### Step 3: Identify Relevant Ingredients & Develop Seed's Unique Narrative

#### Ingredient Discovery & Product Mapping

1. **Analyze Keyword for Ingredients**: 
   - Identify all specific ingredients mentioned (e.g., "melatonin for sleep" â†’ melatonin)
   - For broader topics (e.g., "vitamins for skin"), determine which specific vitamins/ingredients would be discussed

2. **Product Messaging Scan**: 
   - Review ALL three NPD messaging documents (PM-02, DM-02, AM-02)
   - Identify which products contain the relevant ingredients
   - **CRITICAL:** Note if ingredients appear in multiple products:
     * PQQ appears in all three products
     * CoQ10 appears in AM-02 and DM-02
     * GABA appears in PM-02 and AM-02
     * Check for other cross-product ingredients

3. **Develop Seed's Unique Narrative vs. Standard Advice**:
   - Compare the "standard advice" (from Step 1) against Seed's approach in the messaging documents
   - Identify Seed's unique scientific perspective or formulation philosophy:
     * **PM-02 angles**: Bioidentical melatonin dosing, dual-phase release, not overloading the system, calibrating circadian rhythms
     * **DM-02 angles**: Bioavailable forms, comprehensive coverage, synergistic formulation
     * **AM-02 angles**: Sustained energy without crash, nootropic benefits, microbiome support
     * **Cross-product themes**: Microbiome connection, precision dosing, evidence-based formulation
   
4. **Create Expert Quote**:
   - Draft a quote (1-3 sentences) from **"Dirk Gevers, Ph.D."** highlighting this unique perspective or contrasting with standard advice
   - Focus on the *ingredient story*, not the *product story*
   - Explain the science and Seed's "why" behind their approach

5. **Infuse Tone Early**: 
   - For each contrast identified, brainstorm ways to introduce Seed's perspective using a conversational or empathetic hook
   - Example: "We've all heard X, and it makes sense on the surface, right? But what if there's another way to look at it, especially when we consider Y? That's the kind of question we explore at Seed..."

### Step 4: Claims Document Deep Dive

#### Evidence Collection Protocol

1. **Retrieve ALL Relevant Claims Documents**:
   - For each identified ingredient, pull claims from ALL products containing it
   - Example: For PQQ article, retrieve:
     * `/Reference/Claims/PM-02/PM-02-PQQ-Claims.md`
     * `/Reference/Claims/AM-02-PQQ-Claims.md` (if exists)
     * `/Reference/Claims/DM-02/DM-02-PQQ-Claims.md` (if exists)

2. **Extract Key Information**:
   - **Primary Studies**: Use the EXACT studies linked in claims documents as primary sources
   - **Approved Claims**: Note all compliance-approved health claims
   - **Dose Information**: Document the specific doses used in studies vs. product formulation
   - **Context-Specific Benefits**: 
     * Sleep context (PM-02): restorative sleep, circadian rhythm
     * Energy context (AM-02): cognitive function, sustained energy
     * General health (DM-02): cellular health, nutritional support

3. **Multi-Product Integration Strategy**:
   When an ingredient appears in multiple products:
   - Include benefits relevant to ALL contexts
   - Show how the same ingredient serves different purposes
   - Example: "While CoQ10 is often associated with energy production, research shows it also plays a crucial role in cellular health and antioxidant protection"

4. **Compliance Check #1**: 
   - Ensure all claims align with approved language in claims documents
   - Cross-reference with `/Reference/Compliance/What-We-Are-Not-Allowed-To-Say.md`
   - Check against `/Reference/Compliance/NO-NO-WORDS.md`

### Step 5: Develop Article Outline

1. **Create H2/H3 Structure**:
   - Structure MUST follow the Tone Guide recommendations
   - Required sections: Overview, Intro, Body Sections, The Key Insight, FAQs
   - Headers should balance SEO relevance with engaging, question-based style

2. **Outline Design Principles**:
   - Lead with the ingredient story, not product story
   - Incorporate Seed's unique perspectives and contrast with standard advice
   - Address multi-faceted benefits when ingredients appear in multiple products
   - Design outline to answer core user questions (from Step 2)
   - Incorporate unique narratives (from Step 3)

3. **Integrate Tonal Prompts into Outline**:
   For at least 2-3 key H2 or H3 sections (especially those explaining complex concepts or addressing sensitive reader concerns), explicitly add a tonal instruction within the outline:
   - `[Use Analogy Here]`
   - `[Pose Rhetorical Question to Reader]`
   - `[Acknowledge Potential Reader Concern/Embarrassment]`
   - `[Opportunity for Gentle Humor/Relatable Scenario]`
   - `[Explain this like a knowledgeable friend would]`
   - `[Transition with a conversational phrase]`
   - `[Explain Simply]`

### Step 6: Gather Evidence & Identify Key Claims

**IMPORTANT: Limit total academic sources to 12-15 maximum across the entire article**

#### Evidence Hierarchy

1. **Primary Authority (MUST USE)**:
   - Studies directly cited in our claims documents
   - These take absolute priority for substantiating claims
   - Use the exact DOI links provided in claims files

2. **Secondary Research (AS NEEDED)**:
   - Additional peer-reviewed academic literature
   - Only add if our claims documents don't fully cover a necessary topic
   - Must be from last 10 years, preferably meta-analyses or systematic reviews

3. **Citation Strategy**:
   
   **Prioritize citing the following Key Claims:**
   - Specific study results from our claims documents
   - Quantitative data (percentages, dosages, effect sizes)
   - Specific mechanisms of action
   - Direct health claims linking ingredient to benefit
   - Any Seed-specific positioning (bioidentical dosing, etc.)
   - Safety/contraindication information
   - Novel or potentially controversial information
   
   **Generally do NOT cite:**
   - Basic definitions widely understood
   - Common biological processes
   - Broad transitional sentences
   - Simple food/symptom descriptions
   - Common health/lifestyle advice (unless linking to specific study)

4. **Citation Guidelines**:
   - Target approximately 1 citation per 75-100 words for key claims
   - Limit total sources to 12-15 maximum
   - For every source, obtain: DOI link, first author last name, publication year

5. **Frame Claims with Tone in Mind**:
   - **For scientific terms**: Plan to introduce with plain language explanation first, then the term
     * Example: "Think of it like your body's natural sleep timer â€“ that's essentially what we call your circadian rhythm. And research shows... ([Author Year](DOI_URL))."
   - **For complex mechanisms**: Think about how a "knowledgeable friend" would explain this
   - **Anticipate reader questions**: If a claim might seem counterintuitive, address that empathetically
     * Example: "Now, this might sound a bit alarming, but don't worry... here's what the science actually means for you... ([Author Year](DOI_URL))."

6. **Compliance Check #2**: 
   - Double-check all claims against Compliance Rules and approved language

- **Use techniques**: Direct address ("you," "your"), contractions, occasional rhetorical questions, gentle self-deprecation where appropriate
- **Prioritize accessibility**: Explain scientific concepts using analogies, metaphors, and plain language before or alongside technical terms
- **Inject personality**: Look for natural opportunities for light, appropriate humor or relatable scenarios
- **Tonal Scaffolding**: For complex sections, first draft 2-3 sentences of pure conversational explanation without citations, then weave in the necessary key claims and citations

#### Article Structure

1. **### Overview** section (3-5 bullet points summarizing key takeaways)

2. **Engaging Introduction**: 
   - Immediately answer the primary user question in the first 1-2 paragraphs
   - Provide a compelling reason to continue reading
   - Emulate the style of Sample Articles introductions
