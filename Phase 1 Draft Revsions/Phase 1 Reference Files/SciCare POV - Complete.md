## Athletic Greens (AG1®) vs DS-01®

### NOTE:

**NOTE:** as of May 2025; AG1 released a [new product](https://drinkag1.com/next-generation) **Next Generation (5 strains, some overlap with DS-01) so this information is outdated. Please update card \+ add a grab-bag task in Asana if you complete an updated lit dive.**

### EMAIL

The major differences between DS-01® Daily Synbiotic and AG1® appear to be **\[brief summary\]**.

On the other hand, [Athletic Greens](https://athleticgreens.com/ingredients/en?gclid=Cj0KCQiA8ICOBhDmARIsAEGI6o1Z9G2ncsU_UToITre0WLKYnCoY_v6zZudDr8J584CDX0N7yFZBmRYaAgGNEALw_wcB) (AG1®) is a dietary supplement that contains a number of ingredients, including vitamins \+ minerals, a phytonutrient blend, and two probiotic strains from the *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium* genera which totals 7.2 billion CFU.

Further, while AG1® comes in a powdered format, DS-01® strains are safely housed in our registered 2-in-1 nested capsule delivery technology, ViaCap®, which is a proprietary capsule-in-capsule system designed to safeguard the viability of the probiotic organisms through digestion for delivery to the colon.

In sum, DS-01® and AG1® are two fundamentally different supplement categories—with AG1® being a predominantly a whole-foods based greens powder with added vitamins and minerals, phytonutrients, and two probiotic strains, whereas DS-01® is a clinically studied synbiotic product offering a unique, encapsulated blend of 24 clinically and scientifically studied probiotic strains and a polyphenol-based prebiotic, to provide benefits in and beyond the gut.

**\[OPTIONAL ADD-ON:** To note, there may be some functional redundancy as Athletic Greens also contains probiotics within the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera; however, unlike with some vitamins and minerals, probiotics have not been shown to reach levels of toxicity as they do not enter systemic circulation. That said, it's important that any company is transparent about the scientific studies and benefits associated with the strains in their product and that that product has undergone rigorous testing for potency and purity, and also survives in GI transit. **\]**

## Ritual Synbiotic+ vs DS-01®:

### NOTE:

**NOTE:** as of May 2025; Ritual tested their prenatal vitamin clinically, so any information on that supplement is outdated \-- there may be updated study information for their Synbiotic as well (so check the below on their website before use of the language). Please update card \+ add a grab-bag task in Asana if you complete an updated dive on the Ritual Synbiotic.

### EMAIL

[Start with the information on DS-01® **here**](https://app.getguru.com/folders/TaBA6Bec/Product-Comparisons)

In contrast, [Ritual’s Gut Health Synbiotic+](https://ritual.com/products/synbiotic-plus-for-gut-health) is marketed as a 3-in-1 supplement that includes prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics. It includes two bacterial strains from the *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium* genera, claiming to contain a total of 11 billion CFU, along with four bacteriophage strains incorporated as a potential prebiotic blend. Additionally, it contains Tributyrin, which is a synthetically derived ingredient with claims of functioning as a postbiotic.

That said, if you're interested in learning more about the differences between various '-biotics'—you can check out our Cultured article, [‘Your Definitive Guide to All the '-Biotics'.’](https://seed.com/cultured/guide-to-all-the-biotics/)

In sum, the major differences between Seed’s DS-01® Daily Synbiotic and [Ritual’s Gut Health Synbiotic+](https://ritual.com/products/synbiotic-plus-for-gut-health) appear to lie in their compositions (included strains and prebiotics, and the inclusion/exclusion of a postbiotic component). So, while DS-01® is a clinically studied, broad spectrum synbiotic offering a unique encapsulated blend of 24 clinically and scientifically studied probiotic strains from the *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium* genera and a polyphenol-based prebiotic, for benefits in and beyond the gut—[Ritual’s Gut Health Synbiotic+](https://ritual.com/products/synbiotic-plus-for-gut-health) formulation is primarily composed of two probiotics strains from the *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium* genera in addition to other ingredients with benefit claims to support a balanced gut microbiome.

All said, supplements on the market containing probiotics vary widely in regards to probiotic strains, dosages and delivery systems—all of which impact the amount of live bacteria delivered to the colon, and, subsequently, any potential benefits. As benefits for probiotics are assessed at a strain and dosage level, one product cannot simply replace another. If you have any questions about what supplement is right for you, it's best to work with a health care provider who can advise on the appropriate product for your ecosystem and the benefits you desire.

## Akkermansia

### Can you share more research about *Akkermansia*?

#### short Summary

*Akkermansia muciniphila* is a naturally occurring gut bacterium that likely plays a key role in maintaining gut health, particularly through its ability to break down mucins and [support](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11297771/) gut barrier integrity. Its abundance in the gut has been [linked](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9300896/) to lower body weight, reduced inflammation, and improved metabolic markers, with studies showing potential [benefits](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33449810/) in conditions like obesity and type 2 diabetes. Notably, supplementation has shown promise in enhancing insulin sensitivity and decreasing inflammatory markers in [clinical](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6699990/) and [preclinical](https://immunityageing.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12979-019-0145-z) models.

#### LONGER VERSION / OPTIONAL SECTIONS

*Akkermansia muciniphila* is a naturally occurring bacterium in the human gut that has been widely studied for its role in metabolic health. Higher levels of this microbe are generally [associated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6163243/#:~:text=muciniphila%20has%20been%20associated%20with,decreased%20%5B6%2C7%5D.)\*\*) with better gut health and are more commonly [observed](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9300896/) in individuals with healthier weight and metabolic profiles. In contrast, lower abundance has been [noted](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9300896/) in those with obesity, diabetes, and certain [bowel conditions](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20648002/). Interventional [studies](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6223323/) have shown that greater *A. muciniphila* levels correlate with reduced inflammation, lower body weight, and improved markers for metabolic syndrome, as well as both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

**\[*Clinical Evidence/Metabolic Health...*** A clinical [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6699990/) involving individuals with overweight or obesity and insulin resistance demonstrated that supplementation with *A. muciniphila* led to measurable improvements in glucose metabolism and cardiometabolic health. Participants showed increased insulin sensitivity, decreased insulin resistance (via HOMA-IR), and reduced white blood cell counts—an inflammatory marker often linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes. In rodent [models](https://immunityageing.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12979-019-0145-z), supplementation also enhanced colonic mucus production, though it did not significantly shift the overall gut microbiota composition.**\]**

**\[*Mechanisms of Actions...*** Mechanistically, *A. muciniphila* thrives by breaking down mucins—proteins found in the intestinal lining. This activity supports the [gut barrier](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11297771/), promotes the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and may offer [protection](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28530168/) against pathogens. Interestingly, given the [transient](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3424311/) nature of most probiotic strains, *A. muciniphila* is thought to deliver its benefits not by reshaping the microbiome, but by modulating gene expression related to host metabolism within the existing microbial ecosystem.**\]**

**\[*Increasing innate levels / challenges in cultivation...*** *Akkermansia* levels can be influenced through means beyond direct probiotic supplementation. Research [suggests](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6223323/) that certain prebiotics, diets rich in polyphenols, fiber, and antioxidants, and medications such as metformin or vancomycin can help support its natural abundance. Despite its promise, *A. muciniphila* is not commonly found in commercial probiotic formulations due to the technical [challenges](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10782997/) of cultivating this strict anaerobe—it requires a fully oxygen-free environment to grow and has highly specific growth needs.**\]**

**\[*Controversy for IBD...*** While much of the evidence highlights its potential in metabolic health, the role of *A. muciniphila* in other conditions—such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colitis—remains less clear. For example, one [study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0074963) found that the strain *A. muciniphila* ATCC BAA-835 alleviated acute colitis in mice, but worsened inflammation in others infected with *Salmonella Typhimurium*. These findings underscore the importance of context and strain specificity in understanding its broader applications.**\]**

### Does DS-01® support the production of *Akkermansia*?

#### short Summary

We haven’t studied whether DS-01® Daily Synbiotic impacts *Akkermansia muciniphila* levels in the human gut, and current research on this connection remains early and inconclusive. Some studies suggest that traditional probiotics like *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium* may indirectly support *A. muciniphila* through mechanisms like SCFA production and increased mucin availability, though this has mostly been observed in [animal models](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27143680/). While diet, certain prebiotics, and medications like metformin have been [shown](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6223323/) to support *A. muciniphila* abundance, we wouldn’t recommend DS-01® or similar probiotics solely for this purpose at this time.

#### long version

While we haven’t conducted research specifically examining whether DS-01® impacts the growth of *Akkermansia muciniphila* in the gut, we’re happy to share some relevant insights from the broader scientific literature that may be helpful.

*A. muciniphila* is a naturally occurring resident of the human gut, and its abundance can be supported through several approaches beyond a targeted probiotic. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6223323/) has shown that certain prebiotics, diets rich in plant polyphenols, fibers, and antioxidants, as well as specific medications like metformin and select antibiotics (such as vancomycin), may help increase and sustain its levels.

Importantly, *A. muciniphila* occupies a specialized niche in the gut, where it breaks down mucins—proteins found in the intestinal lining. This mucin-processing role contributes to gut barrier [integrity](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11297771/), supports the production of beneficial short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and may offer [protection](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28530168/) against pathogens.

Some research has explored the potential for traditional probiotics—specifically those in the *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium* genera—to indirectly influence *A. muciniphila* levels. The theory is that these probiotics can enhance SCFA production, which in turn supports mucin growth, creating a more favorable environment for *A. muciniphila* to thrive. Animal studies have observed [increases](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27143680/) in *A. muciniphila* abundance following supplementation with these traditional probiotics, though it’s still unclear whether these findings translate to humans.Because of this, we wouldn’t recommend relying on DS-01® or other *Lactobacillus*\- or *Bifidobacterium*\-based probiotics as a dependable strategy for increasing *A. muciniphila* levels. That said, if you’re considering supplementing with a targeted *A. muciniphila* product, there’s no known contraindication to combining it with DS-01®.

## Acne

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

**\[optional intro if asking about DS-01® Dermatological Benefits:**

While DS-01® does include strains which have been [studied](https://seed.com/reference/syn-wk)​ to support skin health and reinforced the gut-skin axis, our product has not been specifically studied in populations with acne, so we therefore cannot comment on any specific effects in this regard. \]

Interestingly, emerging evidence indicates that there is [extensive cross-communication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6048199/) between the skin, its associated microbiome, and the gut microbiome. In fact, this is now referred to as the “gut-skin axis.”

However, there are many potential causes of acne and the exact relationship of the [gut microbiota](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9318165/)​ on acne, pathogenesis remains elusive. One [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29756631/)​ showed patients with acne had a different microbiota than those without acne—suggesting the gut microbiome dysbiosis *may* have an effect on acne.

Further, [scientific evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049923) suggests that certain probiotic strains show promise as effective treatments in some inflammatory skin conditions, such as atopic dermatitis, acne vulgaris, and psoriasis.

Currently, probiotic use for acne is still not well-understood—however, [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8953587/)​​ regarding probiotics for acne is still developing and further studies \+ trials may lead to more conclusive answer.

## Unisex Probiotics

### Version 1 (summary / most simple) — ""Why is there not a probiotic differentiated by sex?""

We do not have separate male and female formulations—however, you may be aware that we used to. In Fall of 2019, we unified our adult synbiotic into a single unisex formulation: DS-01® Daily Synbiotic.

For context, contrary to nutritional guidelines for other compounds such as micronutrients (vitamins \+ minerals) and macronutrients (including things like protein and fiber), probiotic recommendations are not differentiated based on biological sex.

Benefits for probiotic organisms are assessed on both a strain (for example, *Lactobacillus plantarum* SD-LP1-IT) and dosage (for example, 10 million CFU) level. In addition, apart from a few specified areas (such as reproductive health), research in probiotics is conducted mostly in heterogeneous populations (which means both men and women are included).

Furthermore, science has revealed that In 2007, the National Institute of Health spearheaded a $173 million Human Microbiome Project (HMP) with the goal of characterizing the human microbiome and to determine if changes in microbiome composition could be correlated with health and disease. The project encompassed 5 years of research and over 200 scientists—and concluded in 2012 that there is no universally healthy microbiome.

While there are [preliminary findings](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6920072/) which demonstrate differences in the microbiome(s) of men and women, the HMP revealed that the metabolic function of our microbiome is much more important than which microbial species are present. This means what your bacteria are *doing* is much more important than who they *are*.

Of note as well, the magnitude of the contribution of biological sex to the gut microbiota is not so clear when compared with other factors such as diet, lifestyle and medication.

This all in mind, most scientifically-supported probiotics on the market today are unisex and look at specific strains of beneficial bacteria that have been studied in a heterogenous population. You may access our strain-specific clinical trials [here](http://seed.com/reference/?tab=studies).

### Who is DS for (sex/gender identity)

DS-01® is for all humans ages 18+, regardless of sex or gender identity, and was formulated with research conducted in heterogenous populations (including men and women).

I hear your feedback around our commercials, and understand why this may have been confusing. Our sincerest apologies, and I’ve passed this along to our Creative Team so we can evolve moving forward.

## Weight loss / modulation

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

Of note, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied for its effects on weight specifically; therefore, we are unable to comment on any difference in effect in this regard. That said, we'd be happy to share the literature surrounding probiotics and weight modulation.

### If pertinent to acclimation / within the first month of member's product experience

While a temporary acclimation period is normal to experience when first beginning a new probiotic, any effects from this are generally confined to the gastrointestinal system and include things like changes to stool patterns, or mild GI discomfort, for example.

That said, aside from some temporary and mild bloating or increased gas during acclimation, kindly note that weight **\[gain / loss\]** is not an anticipated effect of probiotic use.

**\[Refer to:** [I am feeling \[UNCOMMON acclimation symptom\] is this normal?](https://app.getguru.com/card/TokBo48c/I-am-feeling-UNCOMMON-acclimation-symptom-is-this-normal-) / [My child is feeling \[UNCOMMON acclimation effect\], is this normal?](https://app.getguru.com/card/TG45rjzc/My-child-is-feeling-UNCOMMON-acclimation-effect-is-this-normal-) **\]**

Though the relationship between the microbiome and weight management is not clearly defined, there is certainly a great deal of exciting [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7333005/) that is being conducted to explore how metabolism and energy homeostasis are impacted by the microbiome as a whole—and how supplements such as probiotics and synbiotics can be leveraged to help promote weight loss.

### Social

**Comment/public:**

DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been specifically studied for its impact on weight, though it may provide probiotic and prebiotic support for optimal gut function and overall health. And while exciting research is being conducted to explore how metabolism and energy homeostasis may be impacted by the microbiome and probiotics, scientists are still unraveling the complex potential interactions between the microbiome and weight management. To learn more about this developing field, you can check out our Cultured article: [https://seed.com/cultured/why-dieting-doesnt-always-work/](https://seed.com/cultured/why-dieting-doesnt-always-work/) 🌱

### Version 2 (deeper explanation)

Of note, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied for its effects on weights specifically; therefore, we are unable to comment on any difference in effect or utility within this population. That said, we'd be happy to share the literature surrounding probiotics and weight modulation.

Interestingly, the diversity of the microbiome appears to be an important factor—one [systematic review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8796717/)​ found there was a positive association between increased weight loss and increased diversity. Similarly, individuals living with obesity displayed [lower diversity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5497371/)​ in their microbial composition. With this said, a shift in the gut microbial community is known to be related to obesity; however, it is still not clear which bacteria or bacterial community ""causes"" or ""fixes"" obesity\]

Though there is more to be elucidated, studies using probiotics for weight loss/gain are starting to gain traction. For example, in one study, introducing a [probiotic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10421457/)​ containing *Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium longum,* and *Enterococcus faecalis* was able to slow down weight gain, especially for individuals on a high-carbohydrate diet. Similarly, a clinical trial leveraging [\_Lactobacillus rhamnosus \_CGMCC1.3724](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24299712/) also showed reduction in body weight and fat mass.

In contrast, there have been other studies which have shown varying impacts of probiotics on weight loss, with results varying based on the species and strain. For example, one [meta-analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882401012001106?via%3Dihub) (combining both human and animal studies) revealed that certain species within the *Lactobacillus* genus can have differing outcomes on weight modulation. This study showed that the species *Lactobacillus gasseri* and *Lactobacillus plantarum* may exhibit positive effects on weight loss, while other species in the Lactobacillus genus, such as *Lactobacillus acidophilus*, *Lactobacillus fermentum*, and *Lactobacillus ingluviei* may be associated with weight gain. That said, effects can even go as far as being strain-specific, or even dependent upon interactions with other bacterial strains—while some studies indicate *L. acidophilus* is associated with weight gain, other [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8540110/) suggest *L. acidophilus* may be beneficial for weight loss when in combination with other probiotic species.

This all in mind, it is important to remember that this field is still fairly new and continuing to develop, and a majority of studies focus on an obese population. More research needs to be done to fully clarify the connection and related mechanisms between weight and the gut, as well as any interventions or supplements that could have utility.

Ultimately, should you have any questions about the effects you’ve experienced or feel they may be adverse, we would always recommend discussing with your physician who may advise with your unique health history in mind.

### Semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy) / Tirzepatide (Mounjaro)

Semaglutide **\[or other GLP-1 receptor agonist\]** is the active ingredient found in Wegovy® or Ozempic®.

For some context, GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) work by [slowing your digestion](https://dom-pubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/dom.14373)—more specifically, by slowing your gastric emptying rate (the speed at which substances leave the stomach after ingestion)—to help you feel less hungry.

With this in mind, it is possible that DS-01® may be released at a varied rate in the GI tract under semaglutide's influence, though we cannot say with certainty without having conducted studies to that end.

Additionally, medications like GLP-1 RAs can sometimes have side effects that impact digestion (like nausea or changes in stool patterns) as your body acclimates to them. If these ever become uncomfortable, you can try temporarily adjusting your DS-01® intake to see if this helps, starting with dropping down to one capsule until you feel ready to proceed back up to two.

Ultimately, we recommend keeping track of how you're feeling and any gastrointestinal changes you may be experiencing. We also suggest having an informed discussion with your healthcare provider, as they are able to advise in regards to your medication \+ supplement regimen within the context of your unique medical history.

**\[ALT (tirzepatide/Mounjaro):** As you are likely aware, tirzepatide—the active ingredient in **\[Mounjaro®/Zepbound®\]**— works by [slowing your digestion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10614464/)​. More specifically, it works by slowing your gastric emptying rate (the speed at which substances leave the stomach after ingestion)—to help you feel less hungry. With this in mind, it is possible that DS-01® may be released earlier in the GI tract under tirzepatide's influence, though we cannot say with certainty without having conducted studies to that end. \]

### Appetite / Hunger \+ Probiotics

**\[OPTIONAL: intro to gut-brain axis:** Recently, although a relatively new field of study, there is research on the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the brain—known as the “gut-brain axis”—whereby the two influence each other through biochemical signaling. This axis has most notably been connected to [cognition and mood disorders](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6469458/). \]

It is hypothesized that through this gut-brain axis, probiotics *may* have an effect on appetite. However, current research is highly variable. For example, one study found probiotic supplementation improved appetites for [patients with depression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31338923/). However, research also identifies that acetate, the main SCFA produced by bacteria in many probiotic products, [suppresses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9102524/) appetite. Nonetheless, a third [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33143930/)​ found that probiotics have minimal effects on appetite-related hormones. ​Thus, this field is still developing and more studies are needed to clarify the role of probiotics in appetite and hunger. Additionally, it is important to note that this variability may be in part because benefits for probiotic organisms are assessed at strain and dosage level, and therefore, impact of the organisms ultimately differs greatly depending on the specific strains used.

Though the relationship between the microbiome and appetite is not clearly defined, there is certainly a great deal of exciting [research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29037268/) that is being conducted to explore how insulin sensitivity and hormones, and other factors related to appetite management, are impacted by the microbiome as a whole—and how supplements such as probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics can be leveraged to help promote appetite control.

### Eating Disorders

To start, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied in individuals living with eating disorders specifically; therefore, we are unable to comment on any difference in effect or utility within these populations. In addition, DS-01® is not considered or regulated as a therapeutic and is therefore not intended to treat or prevent any condition or disease state.

For context, DS-01® is formulated to support multiple markers of digestive and systemic health to reinforce a healthy overall gastrointestinal system and provide core benefits to gut barrier integrity, immune health, cardiovascular health, micronutrient synthesis and dermatological health. [Research](https://seed.com/reference/syn-wk) demonstrates strains in DS-01® promote healthy regularity, ease of occasional digestive discomforts, improvement in intestinal environment, and a balanced gut microbiome.

Based on the research available to us today, we know that the gut microbiome is a major [regulator](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-021-01093-y) of feeding and appetitive behaviors, as well as mental health, through diverse pathways and mechanisms (now identified as the ['gut-brain axis'](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6469458/)). To date, there has been quite a bit of growing clinical [research](https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-022-00681-z) on probiotics' effect on feeding and eating disorders, particularly concerning how the gut microbiota may perpetuate disordered eating behaviors, or make weight regain difficult. Some [research](https://www.cell.com/trends/molecular-medicine/fulltext/S1471-4914\(23\)00269-1?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1471491423002691%3Fshowall%3Dtrue)) investigates the relationship between microbiota and the genetics of individuals with eating disorders.

All said, as with any supplement, individual responses to probiotics can and do vary, and therapies for feeding and eating disorders issues are constantly evolving and certainly not a 'one size fits all' solution. As such, it may be pertinent to consult with your personal physician who can advise on your probiotic and supplement routine within the context of your complete medical history.

### Blood sugar / diabetes / pre-diabetes

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

Since diabetes mellitus is a multifactorial disorder, the precise mechanism of action for any specific anti-diabetic effects of probiotics have not been fully established.

That said, it is [thought](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22572877/) that alterations in glucose homeostasis are associated with low-grade inflammation promoted by gut microbiota–derived endotoxins. There is a growing body of [literature](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature18646) to support differences in the host gut microbiome of insulin-resistant individuals compared to a healthy counterpart—one [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06466-x) found not only bacteria associations, but also gut microbial metabolite associations in insulin resistance compared to insulin sensitivity. [Research](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11450/) has demonstrated that imbalances in the composition and function of the intestinal bacteria can lead to blood glucose irregularities, thereby increasing the risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

A recent [meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27864537/) of 13 clinical trials suggested that administration of probiotics appears to have a beneficial role in the management of Type 2 diabetes; however, more rigorous clinical studies with larger sample sizes are required to develop strain-specific applications and treatment guidelines.

## Oral/Dental \+ Gut / 'bad breath'

### Halitosis (impacts on gut / oral)

It is known the oral microbiome can affect the gut microbiota—the [oral to gut transmission](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6427756/)​ is better studied than the reverse. One possible gut to oral transmission is rather more focused on [fecal-oral](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8125773/)​ transmission. However, there are some studies that suggest gut [dysbiosis](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20002297.2023.2213112)​ may have an impact on the oral microbiota; albeit, these studies were conducted under the context of diabetes.

While probiotics supplementation is actively researched for halitosis treatment, these generally involved a [slow-release oral tablet](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32379992/)​ (not ingested), [chewable tablet](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31799694/)​, [gum](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31799694/)​, or an [oral rinse](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4843589/)​. Effects of orally-ingested probiotics have been less investigated for halitosis.

In sum, the oral-gut axis is better studied in one direction than the other (gut to oral) and the use of probiotics for halitosis requires further studies and trials.

### Halitosis (general information and oral microbiome \+ halitosis \+ probiotics)

To start with a caveat, it is important to mention that my team and I are not able to offer personalized medical advice, though I am happy to share some information about what the scientific research currently says regarding halitosis, the oral microbiome, and probiotics.

Similar to the gut microbiome, the human [oral microbiome](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11084736/)​ is highly diverse and has a complex ecology—comprised of bacteria, microeukaryotes, archaea and viruses—and plays a very important role in not only oral health, but also systemic health.

Regarding [halitosis](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7465478/)​ specifically, this is a relatively common ailment involving 15%-60% of the population. The most common form of halitosis is called intra-oral halitosis (IOH) (as opposed to extra-oral halitosis (EOH), which originates from other areas of the body). Intra-oral halitosis is formed by volatile compounds, which are produced mainly by anaerobic bacteria.

Next, referring to [probiotics](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10534711/)​, some studies​ ([1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7908094/)​, [2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37493204/)​) have suggested that probiotics may be effective for halitosis, however, not all [studies](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11172044/)​ agree. Thus far, based on that state of the literature, it's challenging to make any conclusions due to [limitations](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30729452/)​ of current research—such as small studies, poor study design, varying probiotic strains/dosages, and inconsistent data.

Given this, although the literature is promising, more studies are needed before being able to conclusively recommend which probiotic strains and dosages might be effective for halitosis.

### Dental Biofilm / How to remove / Probiotics Research

Biofilm is a soft, sticky layer of bacteria that naturally forms on your teeth and gums. You might know it as plaque. These bacteria group together and stick to surfaces in your mouth, creating a thin film that's not always visible. If not removed regularly through brushing and flossing, this biofilm can lead to cavities, gum inflammation, and other oral health issues.

While brushing and flossing are the first-line approach for biofilm management, routine dental cleanings are also recommended. A dentist may recommend gross debridement, a more extensive cleaning, in the event of more serious biofilm buildup. In looking the [research](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8468826/#sec3-microorganisms-09-01966)​, scaling and root planing (SRP) is regarded as a gold standard for biofilm removal (done by a dentist), though there is a novel approach known as “guided biofilm therapy” (GBT), which is also an option.

That said, there has been some research to suggest that probiotics may be helpful interventions for various oral diseases, such as dental caries, oral mucositis, and halitosis (this Nature [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41522-024-00488-7)​ provides some additional insight, see the probiotics section).

For example, various [*Lactobacillus*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17697171/)​ species may have an effect on *Streptococcus mutans*, which is a bacteria in the mouth that can cause dental carries.

All in all, oral microbial health and oral-focused probiotics this is a growing and developing field, and more studies are needed in order to identify which strains and in which formats (e.g., chewable, capsule, or yogurt), may be the most beneficial.

### Impact of antiseptic mouthwash on gut microbiome

Similar to the gut microbiome, the human [oral microbiome](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11084736/)​ is highly diverse and has a complex ecology—comprised of bacteria, microeukaryotes, archaea and viruses—and plays a very important role in not only oral health, but also systemic health.

To note, some alcohol-based and antiseptic mouthwashes can indeed [disrupt](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10690560/)​ the oral microbiome by broadly reducing both commensal and pathogenic bacteria. Although mouthwashes are effective for managing oral health, their impact on the oral microbiome certainly warrants further evaluation. Interestingly, preserving the balance of the oral microbiome by supporting beneficial species while thoughtfully managing harmful ones is emerging as an important principle in oral health, offering a more targeted approach than broad-spectrum microbial elimination.

That said, it’s important to mention that DS-01® Daily Synbiotic is specifically engineered with our 2-in-1 capsule delivery technology, ViaCap®. For context, ViaCap® is a proprietary capsule-in-capsule system we developed to safeguard the viability of the probiotic organisms in DS-01® through digestion, for complete delivery to the colon.

While antiseptic mouthwashes may temporarily affect the balance of the oral microbiome, they would not be anticipated to impact the strains in DS-01® or interfere with its core activity in the colon. In other words, any local disruption in the mouth would not negate the work DS-01® does at the site where it matters most for systemic and digestive health.

## Digestive Enzymes

### Version 1 (Summary)

There are no known contraindications between probiotics and other dietary supplements; therefore, DS-01® should be fine to combine with supplements, such as digestive enzymes.

However, it's important to note that we haven't conducted clinical studies specifically on how DS-01® interacts with digestive enzyme supplements. Research in this area is still emerging.

Of note, one randomized controlled [trial](https://journals.lww.com/jfmpc/Fulltext/2020/09020/A_prospective,_randomized,_open_label,.115.aspx) involving older adults evaluated the combined supplementation of digestive enzymes and spore-based probiotics. The study observed positive effects on indigestion, with no significant adverse events.

In addition, preclinical studies have also explored the co-administration of probiotics and digestive enzymes in animal and *in vitro* models. For instance, one [study](https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-016-0945-2) involving mice suggested that a blend of probiotics and enzymes may positively impact cholesterol metabolism. Another [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33859242/) in Nile tilapia observed improved nutrient absorption and microbial balance when digestive enzymes and probiotics were co-administered.

While current findings offer intriguing insights into the co-administration of probiotics and digestive enzymes, the evidence is not strain-specific. As such, further robust, strain-specific research is warranted to better understand the relevance of these combinations in human health.

From a health education perspective, digestive enzymes are naturally produced by the body and become active during digestion—starting with [amylase](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/digestive-system-how-it-works#:~:text=bile%2C%20and%20enzymes-,Mouth.,down%20starches%20in%20your%20food.) in the saliva and continuing throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Because enzymes are a routine part of digestion, the potential interaction with probiotics has been a subject of scientific curiosity.

That’s exactly why DS-01® is delivered via our proprietary ViaCap® technology—a 2-in-1 nested capsule system specifically designed to protect the viability of the probiotic strains as they pass through the digestive tract and ensure delivery to the colon.

In fact, DS-01® has been evaluated using the SHIME® *in vitro* model of the human gut, which simulates both fasted and fed states. Results indicate that DS-01® performs well both in fasted (no food) and fed (after food) states.

If interested, feel free to check out our [Cultured article](https://seed.com/cultured/digestive-enzymes-vs-probiotics-gut-health-guide/) discussing this topic of probiotics and digestive enzymes.

This all in mind, we recommend finding a method of intake that feels best and is well tolerated by your body. The most important thing is consistent daily intake.

Ultimately, we would also suggest consulting with your health care provider to determine the best course of action regarding your supplement routine.

**\[OPTIONAL ADD ON if they're asking about the difference between the two / 'would it be redundant to take both?':** For further context, digestive enzymes are usually plant-based compounds that help your body break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins from food. Probiotics are live microorganisms that provide a specific benefit to the host (humans) and prebiotics are utilized by gut microbes to produce certain metabolites.

As such, probiotics/prebiotics and digestive enzymes carry separate properties and serve separate functions and it is your personal choice (with guidance from your healthcare team) on whether or not a supplemental digestive enzyme may be appropriate or beneficial for you.**\]**

**\[OPTIONAL ADD ON: CAN IT REPLACE MY DIGESTIVE ENZYME SUPPLEMENT? :** Do note, probiotics fall under a different supplement category than a digestive enzyme, and can aid digestion in supportive but different mechanisms than digestive enzymes; therefore, DS-01® is not intended to replace this, or any other supplement. To learn more about the differences between probiotics \+ digestive enzyme supplements, you can read more [here](https://seed.com/cultured/digestive-enzyme/).**\]**

## C. Difficile Infection (CDI) \+ Probiotics

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

**\[If pertinent to product:**

It’s important to note that DS-01® Daily Synbiotic is regulated by the FDA as a dietary supplement, and as such, is not intended to treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition. Additionally, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied in individuals living with C. difficile infection (CDI) specifically; therefore, we are unable to comment on any difference in effect or utility within this population.

That said, I'd be happy to share some information on the research landscape of probiotics and CDI, if that is of use. **\]**

Many [studies](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6335148/)​ have examined how probiotics might be used to prevent the development of CDI in those who are most vulnerable to it (typically, [individuals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK431054/)​ who are hospitalized and receiving multiple antibiotics), or minimize some associated symptoms. **\[OPTIONAL Example:** For example, a large observational [study](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/60/suppl_2/S144/380185) was also conducted over ten years, which found that the strains *Lactobacillus acidophilus* CL1285, *Lactobacillus casei* LBC80R, and *Lactobacillus rhamnosus* CLR2 may be helpful in decreasing the overall rate of *C. difficile* infection.\]

That said, some of these studies have been promising, [results](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9743071/)​ have overall been mixed, leading to a lack of consensus about which strains (or combinations) are most effective at preventing CDI. In addition, most studies focus on prevention, rather than how probiotics might be used alongside or after antibiotic therapy for CDI.

All in all, much more human clinical research is needed to determine the optimal use of probiotics in the prevention, treatment, and recovery of CDI.

**\[optional add-in on nomenclature:** C. difficile was previously classified as *Clostridium difficile*, but its genus was reclassified to *Clostridioides* in 2016 based on genetic analysis.**\]**

## Cycling/rotating probiotics / Can probiotics create a monoculture?

While some sources imply that probiotics colonize the gut—and thus, one should switch to a new product once they have colonized to maximize diversity—there is actually little scientific or clinical evidence that supports this notion.

Instead, current research supports the [transient](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3424311/) nature of probiotics—meaning these organisms work by traveling through the digestive tract to impact the body’s resident microbes through complex interactions before eventually [expelling](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3424311/) through stool. This is in contrast to your steady-state or existing microbes, which colonize the gut through early [seeding](https://seed.com/cultured/microbiome-101/) [practices](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9237654/).

As probiotic organisms are transient, the continued use of a particular probiotic is generally necessary to ensure the persistence of benefits. Therefore, since the evidence does not support the idea that probiotics colonize the gut, it is unlikely that your body would become used to these transient probiotic strains **\[OPTIONAL if asking about monoculture:** and that prolonged intake would create a monoculture.**\]** In fact, compared to the tens of trillions of microbes already rooted in your intestinal tract (again, also known as the steady-state microbiome), most probiotics don’t contain enough new bacteria to make a significant difference in the composition of your microbiota through sheer numbers alone. Thus, while it may seem ideal to ‘populate the gut’ through various probiotic supplements, this idea differs from how a complex ecosystem like the human gut microbiome works.

That's not to say that probiotics aren't effective—just that they don't confer benefits through their collective numbers, but rather through their interactions. Further, it is through those interactions that gut microbial diversity can be [supported](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4856465/)​.

With all of the above in mind, consider switching probiotics if you’re looking for different benefits than those demonstrated by your current supplement. When doing so, you’ll want to keep an eye out for a new product with strains that have been studied to confer your specific benefits of interest (check out [this article](https://seed.com/cultured/probiotics-101/) for a deeper dive).

Lastly and most importantly, since each person has a unique and complex physiology and microbial mosaic, the responses to probiotics can and do vary. As such, it may be pertinent to discuss your probiotic intake with a trusted physician who can advise based on your complete health history and current health goals.

### Steady-state microbiome \+ colonization resistance

Compared to the tens of trillions of microbes already rooted in your intestinal tract (also known as the [steady-state microbiome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4315782/)), most probiotics don’t contain enough new bacteria to make a significant difference in the composition of your microbiota through sheer numbers alone. Furthermore, [research](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2021.609722/full#h4) indicates the occurrence of a phenomenon known as “colonization resistance” in which the stable microbial community can resist colonization by external microbes. This can occur directly and indirectly—via factors associated with the gut microbiota (such as competition for resources) or host-derived factors (such as modulation of bile acid concentrations), respectively. Probiotics have been shown to be adversely affected by this resistance exerted by the host gut microbiome.

This is evidenced by the fact that most probiotic strains are no longer recoverable in stool [1–4 weeks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3424311/) after intake ceases. Since probiotic strains constantly move through the gastrointestinal tract before expulsion, their benefits are mainly confined to the duration of consumption—which is why we offer our synbiotics on a subscription basis, as continued consumption is likely required if sustained probiotic benefits are desired.

### More detail on specific interactions between probiotics \+ gut microbiome

These “specific [interactions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6886316/)” involve the numerous relationships between probiotics, local cells (i.e., gut cells, immune cells, etc.), chemical messengers, dietary nutrients, receptors, and the steady-state microbiome to modulate physiological pathways and shape intestinal ecology.

For example, since the small intestine is home to a majority of your [innate immune system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3502877/)—also known as gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT)—probiotic strains interact with local immune cells to influence gut-immune function through targeted probiotic release in the latter part of the small intestine. Notably, DS-01® was intentionally [designed](https://seed.com/reference/syn-wk) and formulated to be released at the end of the small intestine and complete delivery to the colon—where microbes perform the bulk of their work.

Further, some probiotics can also [produce](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21992949/#:~:text=Indirectly%2C%20probiotics%20can%20influence%20colonizing,with%20a%20healthier%20gut%20physiology.)) compounds like bacteriocins and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that inhibit pathogens and influence a healthy commensal gut microbiome. [SCFAs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7230973/) also play a critical role in maintaining intestinal and immune homeostasis in the body.

Still other strains even [produce](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21992949/) substrates (i.e., secreted [exopolysaccharides](https://microbiologyjournal.org/exopolysaccharides-derived-from-probiotic-bacteria-and-their-health-benefits/#:~:text=Health%20benefits%20of%20EPSs,as%20observed%20in%20Figure%203.), vitamins, fatty acids, sugars from undigested carbohydrates, etc.) that may promote the growth of colonizing microbes and encourage the rapid stabilization of bacterial communities after perturbations—as often seen with antibiotic intake.

By interacting with tight junction proteins, probiotics can [reinforce](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5475283/) the barrier between intestinal epithelial cells, reducing the likelihood of bacterial translocation or “leaky gut.” Some strains have even been [found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3539293/) to alter pathways like gene expression patterns related to carbohydrate metabolism as well as [trigger](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5421123/) neurotransmitters to stimulate muscle contractions for increased intestinal motility—think, easy, regular poops.

### Cost Concerns

At $1.60/day, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic is comprised of 24 select globally sourced probiotic strains and a new class of non-fermenting prebiotic compounds—extracted from Indianomegranate—to [support](https://seed.com/reference/syn-wk) multiple digestive, gut health, and systemic benefits. Not to mention, our production pipelines reflect the most advanced technologies and innovations in biofermentation, stabilization, delivery, stability, and testing.

That said, we completely understand that a monthly probiotic subscription is not feasible for all. We offer DS-01® as a subscription because the [transient](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3424311/) nature of probiotics necessitates daily consumption. In other words, if sustained benefit from a probiotic is desired, continued consumption is likely required.

Still, we also recognize that health doesn't solely come in a capsule. While prebiotics and probiotics can support healthy overall gut function, this may only negate some factors that also influence it. We believe there are many ways to [support](https://seed.com/cultured/eating-for-your-gut/) your microbial health, including education. For this reason, Seed is committed to [free knowledge](https://seed.com/cultured/) for all, and you are welcome to learn with us at any time.

**\[OPTIONAL ADD ON for alt phrasing on colonization resistance:** In fact, the gut is generally an “[anti-adherent](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2021.609722/full)” environment. Meaning, it is fairly resistant to change in composition. Probiotics must compete with the host microbiota for nutrients and adhesion sites to be able to colonize the colon and proliferate. Due to the sheer bacterial density in the colon, probiotics are typically excreted out of the colon with stool after oral administration and shortly after consumption ceases.\]

## Celiac Disease

### Version 1 (non-technical)

**\[intro, if needed:** Celiac disease is a condition where the immune system reacts abnormally to gluten—a protein found in foods like wheat, rye, and barley. When people with celiac disease eat gluten, it causes damage to small finger-like structures in the intestine called villi. This can lead to symptoms like belly pain, bloating, diarrhea, fatigue, and problems absorbing nutrients.**\]**

[Current guidelines](https://journals.lww.com/ajg/fulltext/2023/01000/american_college_of_gastroenterology_guidelines.17.aspx) for celiac disease recommend a strict gluten-free diet, but some people still have symptoms even when they carefully avoid gluten. Scientists are now studying the [gut microbiome](https://doi.org/10.3390/cells12060823) as something that might also affect celiac disease. Some think it could be helpful alongside a gluten-free diet.

In people with celiac disease, probiotics might help by breaking down parts of gluten, supporting a healthy immune response, supporting a strong gut barrier, and improving symptoms.

People with celiac disease often have a [gut microbiome that looks different](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/12/1824/htm) from people without the condition. For example, some may have fewer helpful bacteria like *Bifidobacteria* and more bacteria like *Bacteroides.* Some studies show that taking [certain probiotics](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/9/2674), including some from the *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium* genera, can help improve this balance and may reduce symptoms.

For example, in [one study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29688915/) with adults on a gluten-free diet, a mix of five probiotic strains helped improve gut symptoms like bloating and stomach pain. In children, another [small study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27782071/) found that probiotics helped shift their gut bacteria toward a more balanced mix, similar to kids without celiac disease.

Still, experts say more research is needed. [One review of many studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7243837/) found that it’s too early to say for sure whether probiotics should be used to treat celiac disease. Larger, better-designed studies are needed to learn more.

### Version 2 (technical)

**\[intro, if needed:** Celiac Disease (CD) is an autoimmune condition characterized by an abnormal immune response to gluten (a protein found in foods like wheat, rye, and barley). In this condition, gluten triggers inflammation and damage to the small intestinal villi, often resulting in symptoms like abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue.**\]**

Current [clinical guidelines](https://journals.lww.com/ajg/fulltext/2023/01000/american_college_of_gastroenterology_guidelines.17.aspx)​ for CD management focus on strict, lifelong removal of gluten from the diet, as gluten is the known trigger of the immune response in CD. While the gluten-free diet (GFD) remains the cornerstone of treatment, research has increasingly explored the role of [intestinal microbiota](https://doi.org/10.3390/cells12060823)​ in the pathogenesis, progression, and clinical presentation of CD––particularly as a potential adjunct to nutrition therapy.

Proposed mechanisms by which probiotics may support CD management include their potential to partially degrade immunogenic gluten peptides, enhancement of gut barrier integrity, modulation of immune responses, shifts in gut microbial composition, and potential symptom improvement.

Several [studies](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/12/1824/htm) have reported imbalances in the intestinal microbiota of patients with CD, sometimes characterized by an increased abundance of *Bacteroides* species and a decrease in *Bifidobacterium* species. In conjunction with a GFD, certain probiotics (namely from the *Bifidobacterium* and *Lactobacillus* genera\_)\_ have been [shown](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/9/2674) to modulate gut microbiota composition and may enable the pre-digestion of gluten peptides in the intestinal lumen. These effects are associated with reduced inflammation markers, improved intestinal barrier function, and modulation of immune signaling.

**\[add-in for adults:** In a [randomized-controlled trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29688915/) of adults adhering to a GFD, a probiotic mixture containing 5 strains from the *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium* genera (*Lactobacillus casei* LMG 101/37 P-17504, *Lactobacillus plantarum* CECT 4528, *Bifidobacterium animalis* subsp. *lactis* Bi1 LMG P-17502, *Bifidobacterium breve* Bbr8 LMG P-17501), *B. breve* Bl10 LMG P-17500) resulted inclinically significant symptom improvement for patients in the treatment group.**\]**

**\[add-in for children:** In a pilot [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27782071/) of children with CD on a GFD, a probiotic-containing food supplement altered gut microbial composition to more closely match that of healthy individuals, notably, with a decrease in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio.**\]**

That said, a [meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7243837/)​ found that while probiotics may play a supportive role in CD treatment, current clinical trial data remains insufficient to support widespread clinical use. Additional large-scale, well-controlled human studies are needed to clarify their efficacy and define optimal strain selection and dosing strategies

## Biogaia vs PDS-08®

### EMAIL

\[Start with the information on PDS-08® [**here**](https://app.getguru.com/folders/TaBA6Bec/Product-Comparisons)\]

On the other hand, the [BioGaia Immune Active KIDS](https://biogaiausa.com/products/immune-active-kids) supplement is a chewable tablet probiotic with a patented strain of probiotic bacteria known as *Lactobacillus reuteri* DSM 17938, and benefit claims surrounding the digestive and immune systems. Notably, this specific strain is not contained in PDS-08® for reference.

In sum, the major differences between PDS-08® and BioGaia Immune Active KIDS appear to lie in their compositions (included strains, presence / absence of prebiotics), delivery formats, and targeted benefits. PDS-08® is a clinically studied supplement which offers a unique, powdered blend of nine probiotic strains along with a meaningful dose of prebiotic fiber, with specific benefits in and beyond gut health, whileBioGaia Immune Active KIDS includes a single patented strain, benefit claims for digestive and immune health, and is designed in a chewable tablet format.

## Pendulum Therapeutics

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

\[Start with the information on DS-01® [**here**](https://app.getguru.com/folders/TaBA6Bec/Product-Comparisons)\]

...On the other hand, Pendulum Therapeutics offers several probiotic formulations, most of which including strains from the *Akkermansia* genus, as well as a handful of other unique organisms from the *Clostridium, Anaerobutyricum*, and *Bifidobacterium* genera.

For example, their [*Akkermansia*](https://pendulumlife.com/products/pendulum-akkermansia) supplement contains 100 million AFU of the *Akkermansia muciniphila* WB-STR-0001 strain and the prebiotic chicory inulin, and is suggested to support gut health and gut lining.

Additionally, the [Pendulum's GLP-1 Probiotic](https://pendulumlife.com/pages/science-glp-1) is a multi-strain synbiotic formulated with *Akkermansia muciniphila*, *Clostridium butyricum*, and *Bifidobacterium infantis,* is advertised to ""naturally curb cravings"" and to ""help individuals produce more GLP-1 naturally through the inclusion of \[said strains\].""

\[**Optional if asking about the background on Akkermansia:** For some background on *Akkermansia*, [insert up to date research](https://app.getguru.com/card/T6LedoKc/Akkermansia)

## Bioma Health

### EMAIL

The major differences between **DS-01® Daily Synbiotic** and **Bioma Health** appear to be **\[brief summary\]**.

\[Start with the information on DS-01®\*\* [here](https://app.getguru.com/folders/TaBA6Bec/Product-Comparisons)\*\*\]

In contrast, [Bioma Health](https://bioma.health/gut-health/faq?flow=shp)​ is a probiotic supplement that contains 3 species of bacteria from the Bifidobacterium genus totaling 9 billion CFU. Of note, their publicly available label does not contain the strains in their product, so I am unable to compare more specifically.

Bioma Health also contains xylooligosaccharides and tributyrin. Xylooligosaccharides are like other non-digestible carbohydrates (e.g. inulin) used as prebiotics. Tributyrin is a triglyceride (fat) that is a precursor to butyrate—a beneficial metabolite for intestinal health. While promising, a majority of the studies using tributyrin are in [cancer cells](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12679905/)​, [animal models](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37523400/)​, or involved with [livestock](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35949196/)​, rather than in human populations.

Do note, however, the label does not specify the probiotic strains, so I am unable to comment on this. In addition, this product contains organic inulin sourced from Jerusalem artichoke root as their prebiotic component.

In sum, the major differences between DS-01® and The Nue Co. Pre \+ Probiotic appear to lie in their compositions (included strains \+ prebiotics). So, while DS-01® is a clinically studied synbiotic which offers a unique encapsulated blend of 24 clinically and scientifically studied probiotic strains and a polyphenol-based prebiotic, for benefits in and beyond the gut—The Nue Co.'s Pre \+ Probiotic formulation is primarily composed of a single spore-forming Bacillus coagulans strain and inulin with benefit claims to support skin, digestion, immunity, mood and sleep.

## Garden of Life Once Daily Women's

### EMAIL

The major differences between **\[DS-01® Daily Synbiotic / PDS-08® Pediatric Daily Synbiotic\]** and **\[product\]** appear to be **\[brief summary\]**.

\[Start with the information on DS-01® [**here**](https://app.getguru.com/folders/TaBA6Bec/Product-Comparisons)\]

On the other hand, Once Daily Women's contains 16 probiotic strains from the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera, totaling 50 Billion CFU, as well as an organic prebiotic fiber blend of potato starch and acacia fiber. Do note, however, the label does not specify the probiotic strains, so I am unable to comment on this, or if there is overlap between this product and DS-01®.

So, in sum, while both DS-01® and Once Daily Women's are both classified as synbiotic products, the differences lie in the variety and the dosages of the probiotic strains and the prebiotics used.

## Can DS-01® help counter the effects of alcohol?

### Can DS-01® help counter the effects of alcohol?

To start, DS-01® has not been studied in individuals within the context of alcohol use specifically; therefore, we are unable to comment on any difference in effect or utility within this population.

For some added context, DS-01® is formulated to provide support for digestive and systemic health with core benefits across gastrointestinal function, gut barrier integrity, immune health, cardiovascular health, micronutrient synthesis, and dermatological health. DS-01® is not considered or regulated as a therapeutic and is therefore not intended to treat or prevent any condition or disease state.

This in mind, I'm happy to share some information about the research on probiotics and alcohol and where it stands today.

As you may know, ethanol has been shown to induce [gut barrier permeability,](http://%20https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2014.2126) which can negatively impact overall intestinal health. While the research in this field is still in its infancy, some studies have shown probiotics may help [reverse](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8497569/)​ alcohol-induced microbiota changes and restore gut microbial composition post-alcohol use.

In fact a recent *in vitro* [study](https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.01880-22)​ suggests that applying a multi-strain synbiotic—containing *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium* probiotic strains—after disruption to the gut microbiome (such as one caused by alcohol) may help support microbiome ""recovery."" This recovery was measured by increases in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production and shifts in the relative abundance of beneficial commensal organisms. That said, it's important to note that this study was done in a laboratory model simulating human digestion–not in humans themselves.

Ultimately, at this time, we don’t know if DS-01® can help restore gut barrier permeability following ethanol-induced disruption, as further human clinical trials are needed.

While we are unable to say for sure if it is particularly beneficial, you may consider spacing out your DS-01® intake from your alcohol consumption—i.e. taking DS-01® in the morning or afternoon if you plan to consume alcoholic beverages in the evening.

With all of this in mind, we would also ultimately recommend consulting with a physician to help determine the best supplement routine for you based on your full health history.

If you'd like, you are also welcome to learn more about how alcohol may impact the gut microbiome––and how to support your gut health in light of this––in our [Cultured article](https://seed.com/cultured/how-alcohol-damages-your-microbiome/)​ on the topic.

## Antibiotics

### Can I take DS-01® alongside antibiotics?

#### EMAIL

There are no known contraindications between probiotics and medications, so it would be generally safe to take **\[DS-01® / PDS-08® Pediatric\]** Daily Synbiotic while undergoing antibiotic therapy.

In fact, during and after antibiotic use is often considered a good time for probiotics, as numerous studies have shown their ability to mitigate GI distress—such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea in [adults](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8362734/) and [children](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6490796/), and to promote the [resilience](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36382780/) of a healthy gut microbiome following antibiotic therapy.

That said, probiotic efficacy depends on the type used, dose administered, and disease implicated.

Antibiotics also vary in the types of bacteria they kill depending on their pharmacologic properties and respective doses. Therefore, the effects of antibiotics on the gut microbiome are [not uniform](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7106814/) and can have ranging effects on which gut microbes they impact.

As probiotic organisms can be [susceptible](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28797834/) to being killed off by antibiotics, it may be pertinent to space your antibiotic intake as far apart from your probiotic intake as possible—by at least [two hours](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20208051/) or more.

Ultimately, we will always defer to the advice of your prescribing physician, who can advise on the entirety of your supplement and medication routine with your complete health history in mind.

**\[OPTIONAL ADD ON to pitch DS-01 Abx study:** refer to [Can you tell me about the findings from your trial on antibiotic recovery?](https://app.getguru.com/card/5f6469a9-d159-4035-be44-055847f0ae1f)**\]**

#### SOCIAL[https://app.getguru.com/card/5f6469a9-d159-4035-be44-055847f0ae1f](https://app.getguru.com/card/5f6469a9-d159-4035-be44-055847f0ae1f)

There are no known contraindications between probiotics and medications, so it would be generally safe to take DS-01® in conjunction with antibiotics. During and after antibiotic use is often considered a good time for probiotics, as numerous studies have shown their ability to promote a healthy gut microbiome following antibiotic therapy and mitigate GI distress like antibiotic-associated diarrhea. \[1\] Probiotic organisms are susceptible to being killed off by antibiotics \[2\], so it may help to space your antibiotic intake as far apart from your DS-01® as possible (2 hours \+). \[3\] It may also be helpful to consult your prescribing physician, who can advise on your routine with your complete health history in mind.

### **Should I increase my DS-01® dose to re-colonize the gut?**

[*If needed, refer to*](https://app.getguru.com/card/923941e7-2131-4567-8873-b5a7b6334937) [Can I take more than the recommended daily dose of DS-01®?](https://app.getguru.com/card/923941e7-2131-4567-8873-b5a7b6334937) 

While taking more than two capsules daily is generally considered safe, there may not necessarily be any added benefit—even while taking an antibiotic course. In fact, [evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3424311/) suggests that probiotic organisms are transient and generally do not colonize (or repopulate) the gut, even after antibiotic therapy.

This is not to say that probiotics aren’t beneficial within the context of antibiotic recovery. While probiotic strains have been shown to [promote](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36382780/) the resilience of a healthy gut microbiome following antibiotic therapy, they do this through specific [interactions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6886316/) with resident microbes and local cells rather than colonizing the gut.

Further, the recommended daily dose for DS-01® (two capsules per day) is based on the dosages used for each strain in their respective [clinical and scientific studies](https://seed.com/reference/syn-wk).

As such, the best dose is generally the one that has been shown in human clinical trials to produce the intended health benefits.

## Down Syndrome

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

It’s important to note that DS-01® Daily Synbiotic is regulated by the FDA as a dietary supplement, and as such, is not intended to treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition. Additionally, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied in individuals living with Down Syndrome specifically; therefore, we are unable to comment on any difference in effect or utility within this population.

**\[OPTIONAL ADD-ON:** For context, DS-01® is formulated to provide support for digestive and systemic health with core benefits across gastrointestinal function, gut barrier integrity, immune health, cardiovascular health, micronutrient synthesis, and dermatological health. DS-01® is not considered or regulated as a therapeutic and is therefore not intended to treat or prevent any condition or disease state. \]

This in mind, I'd be happy to share with you the current research perspective on Down Syndrome, the gut microbiome, and probiotics. **\[Insert topics below\]**

\[OPTIONAL ADD-ON: While DS-01® is generally safe and tolerable, it is important to note that when starting any new health regimen, some GI distress, is a normal part of the acclimation period. Acclimation length varies per individual, but generally lasts a few weeks.

In those with an already sensitive constitution, the introduction of a potent synbiotic may lead to more pronounced GI symptoms when acclimating. Thus, we advise individuals with pre-existing digestive conditions exercise extra caution when adding a new product to their routine and consult with their primary care provider who may provide guidance with your personal health history in mind. \]

To conclude, the pathophysiology of developmental disorders like Down Syndrome are quite complex in nature, and further research is required to determine more definitive therapeutic recommendations for management. Importantly, we highly encourage consultation with \[your/your family member's\] healthcare practitioner(s) who may advise on specific recommendations with \[your/their\] complete health history in mind.

### Research Option 1 \- Gut microbiome IN down syndrome

Research suggests possible links between gut microbiota and cognitive function—including some exploratory research looking at the role of the gut microbiota in Down Syndrome-associated cognitive changes. Some studies ([1](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0112023), [2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00787-021-01799-2)) have found relationships between certain gut microbes and the increase of some genetic pathways related to neuronal damage, inflammation and/or impaired cognitive functioning in individuals with Down Syndrome.

Chronic constipation in those with Down Syndrome can have [many causes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9837546/)​, including but not limited to low muscle tone, hypothyroidism, or differences in intestinal structure. One [recent study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4227691/)​ found the overall health profiles of the gut microbiome of those with Down syndrome to be similar to those of individuals without Down syndrome, yet also noted key differences in a subgroup of bacteria that is correlated with behavior indices.

That said, research in this area has been limited to animal studies and very specific populations of humans with relatively small sample sizes. Thus, additional robust studies are needed at this time to further understand the exact mechanisms at play between Down Syndrome and the gut microbiota.

### Research Option 2 \- Down Syndrome \+ Probiotics

Of note, individuals with Down Syndrome may commonly [experience](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4017552/) gastrointestinal symptoms as a result of associated organ systems malfunction or [developmental abnormalities](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2943789/) of the gastrointestinal tract, and although it seems reasonable to think probiotics may help mitigate some of the GI symptoms associated with the pathology, there is a lack of clinical evidence to suggest that probiotics are indeed therapeutic within the context of Down Syndrome.

Interestingly, a [new clinical trial](https://www.dsrf-uk.org/probioticsconstipation/)​ is underway in the UK to determine how oral probiotics could impact constipation in children with Down syndrome.

## Probiotics for pets

### H3

**\[if asking for probiotic recommendations for a well pet:** And although I am unable to comment on, or recommend, specific products, it may be helpful to assess these important questions when choosing a probiotic for your pet:

1. Which strains (not just species) are included? In what quantities?  
     
2. Have these strains (in these quantities) undergone clinical / veterinary research?  
     
3. What data supports a product's survivability through all stages of digestion?

Ultimately, we would recommend consulting your personal veterinarian in regards to finding a probiotic for your pet, who would be more in touch with the veterinary literature on this topic and may advise with the complete health history and needs of your pet.**\]**

## Vitiligo / Autoimmune Skin Condition

### NOTE:

Reminder when using research cards to address product-based questions to include relevant regulatory compliance disclaimers.

### Vitiligo / autoimmune

Some [research](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11514916/)​ does suggest that gut and/or skin microbiome [dysbiosis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33771527/)​ may play a role in the severity of symptoms and pathogenesis in vitiligo, and that these microbiome changes show similarities with other autoimmune disorders. This suggests that there could be gut microbiome-mediated mechanisms in autoimmune conditions.

With this in mind, it's possible that [probiotics](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11767946/)​ (either oral or topical) could have an impact on this condition, however, well-designed clinical trials are needed in order in order to effectiveness of specific strains of probiotic bacteria, their relevant dosages, and their optimal delivery format.

---

## Chronic diarrhea

### General: motility / regularity

[Intestinal motility](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7474470/) is a complex process that is regulated by synchronous involvement of the neural and immune systems, gut secretions, the gut microbiota, and their metabolites—and can be influenced by a shift in any of these components.

### Causes of Diarrhea

[Diarrhea](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448082/) can result from a variety of causes such as [viral/bacteria infections](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2014/0201/p180.html), [parasites](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35001606/), [food allergies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482187/), [bowel conditions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9278595/) such as IBS or IBD, or even [psychological stressors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6776710/). The gut’s robust systemic connections mean that increased motility could also be related to other conditions such as [hyperthyroidism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK500006/), or general immunosuppression. Extended cases of watery stool from hypermotility can also result in additional issues such as malnutrition or dehydration as the fecal material is not retained long enough for the intestines to absorb important dietary components.

Acute viral or bacteria infections are a common source of [persistent diarrhea](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK544337/)—and the associated [dysbiosis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9758627/) of the intestinal ecosystem may cause diarrheal symptoms to persist even after the infection has cleared from the system. This may be further aggravated by the therapeutic use of drugs to treat the offending organisms such as [antibiotics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9408191/) or antiparasitics, which are known to significantly disturb the ecosystem of the gut microbiome.

### Treatment

[Antidiarrheal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557885/) medicines and [rehydration](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30269306/) solutions are common therapies to help with issues of diarrhea, alongside treatment regimens to address the cause of the condition. The microbiome-modulating effects of [probiotics](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35057571/) has led to hope for their potential use as an alternative therapy for several of the underlying conditions that can lead to diarrhea.

### Strains in DS-01®

Interestingly, the strain bifidobacterium longum BB536 has been [studied](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22138361) in individuals that were carriers of a certain pathogenic bacteria in their microbiome that has been suggested to be associated with acute and persistent diarrheal disease with positive effects on reducing the cell number of the pathogenic bacteria.

*\[Reminder to keep this strain reference the way it is here due to the way conditions are referenced in relation—see [Regulatory & Compliance Guide for Dietary Supplement Scientific Member Communications \[DS-01® and PDS-08®\] for more clarity](https://app.getguru.com/card/iRGyRkoT/Regulatory-Compliance-Guide-for-Dietary-Supplement-Scientific-Member-Communications-DS01-and-PDS08)\]*

Additionally, several of the strains in DS-01® have been shown to significantly improve multiple markers of digestive health including intestinal [transit time](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20697291), bloating, [discomfort](https://insights.ovid.com/pubmed?pmid=15220671) and improved [stool consistency](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/bifidus1996/16/2/16_2_53/_pdf).

**\[Optional add-on, if the question is in relation to our product**: DS-01® Daily Synbiotic was formulated with a wide variety of strains selected to support overall digestive health, which may help support bowel movement consistency. Several of the strains in DS-01® have been shown to significantly improve multiple markers of gastrointestinal function—including intestinal bloating, discomfort, and improved stool consistency and quality.

It is important to note that as with any supplement, individual responses to probiotics can and do vary—your experience will be unique to you. We would also recommend consulting a primary care provider when adding a new product to your regimen (including ours), as they may best advise on appropriate therapeutics given your health history.**\]**

## Gut-Brain Axis: Mental Health / Mood / Anxiety / Brain Fog / Headaches / Migraines / Appetite / Hunger

### General / intro to gut-brain axis

I'd be happy to share more about the research landscape concerning probiotics and mental health.

Though a relatively new field of study, science has certainly validated the knowledge that the microbiome communicates with the central nervous system via a bidirectional collection of pathways now known as the [gut-brain axis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25830558/). As such, the gut microbiome and the brain are able to influence each other through biochemical signaling. This axis has most notably been connected to [cognition and mood disorders](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6469458/).

New findings in this field emerge constantly, illuminating the impact our gut flora may have on depression and other mood disorders. Current [research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31914909/) interestingly supports the idea that probiotics may play a beneficial role in mood—particularly in depression and anxiety: for example, one [randomized controlled tria](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10501394/)l found a multi-strain probiotic led to improvements in mood, anxiety, and depression. Additionally, [research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32300799/) suggests some probiotics can exert other beneficial effects regarding mood and cognition. For example, one [systematic review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763421002748) concluded that probiotics have the potential to enhance cognitive function or attenuate cognitive decline, though additional research is warranted.

As such, the term [psychobiotic](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31858898/) has emerged: live bacteria which, when ingested, confer mental health benefits.

Importantly however, while research continues to explore the gut-brain axis, further clinical trials are needed to better understand the impacts of probiotics and the gut microbiome on cognitive function.

### Mood Disorders / MIGRAINES \<\> GI Function

Mood disorders share a close interrelationship with disordered gastrointestinal function—made [evident](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nmo.12155) in that intestinal distress is a commonly reported symptom in those with depression and anxiety.

Moreover, mood disorders frequently co-occur with gastrointestinal disorders, such as [irritable bowel syndrome](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24705634/), [Crohn’s disease, and ulcerative colitis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27411754/).

Interestingly, there are also studies that show migraines may be associated with some gastrointestinal (GI) conditions such as [irritable bowel disease](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23875096/)​ (IBS) or [inflammatory bowel disease(IBD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28508514/)​). It is hypothesized the dysbiosis in these GI conditions may contribute to migraines—for example, one study found individuals with migraines had an [altered microbiota](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-27586-4)​ compared to the controls.

### Probiotics as treatment

#### Mood

Notably, probiotics have generated intensive [interest](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4997396/) in recent years as an adjunct to the treatment of some mood disorders. Nevertheless, the mood-boosting potential of probiotics remains unclear. While preclinical and animal studies show promise in the treatment of depression, clinical research in humans has largely been underpowered or lacking.

Animal [results](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18456279/) show that the use of probiotics may lead to an increase in plasma tryptophan levels and reduced concentrations of serotonin in the frontal cortex and of cortical dopamine metabolites, thereby ameliorating depressive symptoms.

**\[Does Wellbutrin interact with DS-01® / is DS-01® contraindicated if I'm taking Wellbutrin?**: Buproprion (Wellbutrin) is metabolized by the liver enzyme [Cytochrome P450 2B6](https://accpjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/phar.2644) (CYP2B6)—which is likely unaffected by pomegranate or other DS-01® ingredients; however, ... [Is DS-01® suitable/safe to take with X medication?](https://app.getguru.com/card/ikRpE6LT/Is-DS01-suitablesafe-to-take-with-X-medication).\*\* \]\*\*

#### Migraines

With this in mind, there are emerging studies focusing on probiotic supplementation for migraine treatments. Some research suggests probiotics can reduce the severity \+ frequency of migraines in [children](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10114277/)​ and [adults](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30621517/)​. However, in contrast, another [trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28537581/) ​found there were no significant differences with probiotic supplementation​.

Due to the variability in studies and the difference in the probiotic dose \+ strain used for each study, more rigorous trials are needed to confirm the effects on migraines.

### Mood / anxiety / Brain Fog \+ probiotic acclimation / side effects

While a temporary acclimation period is normal to experience when first beginning a new probiotic, any effects from this are generally confined to the gastrointestinal system and include things like mild changes to stool patterns, bloating or gas. This in mind, kindly note that **\[mood changes / anxiety / brain fog**\] is not an effect expected of acclimation, nor of probiotic use in general.

Mood: With this in mind, it is pertinent to note that mood changes may occur [for a variety of reasons](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK558911/), relating to factors such as [nutrition](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29985786/), sleep, stress, fluctuations in hormones, genetics and more. We would always advise an informed discussion with your physician if you feel any effects are adverse, as they may most appropriately advise with your unique medical history in mind.

**Migraines:** That said, as there are many potential causes for [headaches](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/headache)​ or [migraines](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/migraine-headache/symptoms-causes/syc-20360201)​, we would always advise an informed discussion with your physician as they may most appropriately advise with your unique medical history in mind.

**\[Refer to:** [I am feeling \[UNCOMMON acclimation symptom\] is this normal?](https://app.getguru.com/card/TokBo48c/I-am-feeling-UNCOMMON-acclimation-symptom-is-this-normal-) / [My child is feeling \[UNCOMMON acclimation effect\], is this normal?](https://app.getguru.com/card/TG45rjzc/My-child-is-feeling-UNCOMMON-acclimation-effect-is-this-normal-) **\]**

### Criticized SIBO / brain fog study

To note, one widely criticized SIBO/“brain fog” [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6240559/) suggested that the probiotic organisms produced a metabolite called D-lactate, which, in elevated amounts, can manifest as brain fog in individuals with short bowel syndrome. However, this study is widely regarded as controversial: it is not a randomized, double-blinded study, and probiotics were not the only therapies being used during the study. In fact, other scientists published an [article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6155354/) to dispute the claims made by the study.

### Headaches / Migraines

Although the gut-brain axis is most notably connected to [cognition and mood disorders](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6469458/), it has been studied in the context of [migraines](https://thejournalofheadacheandpain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s10194-020-1078-9#Abs1)​—specifically on how gut dysbiosis and inflammation may be associated with migraines, albeit the exact mechanisms are still not well-understood.

### Appetite / Hunger \+ Probiotics

It is hypothesized that through this gut-brain axis, probiotics *may* have an effect on appetite. However, current research is highly variable. For example, one study found probiotic supplementation improved appetites for [patients with depression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31338923/). However, research also identifies that acetate, the main SCFA produced by bacteria in many probiotic products, [suppresses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9102524/) appetite. Nonetheless, a third [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33143930/)​ found that probiotics have minimal effects on appetite-related hormones. ​Thus, this field is still developing and more studies are needed to clarify the role of probiotics in appetite and hunger. Additionally, it is important to note that this variability may be in part because benefits for probiotic organisms are assessed at strain and dosage level, and therefore, impact of the organisms ultimately differs greatly depending on the specific strains used.

Though the relationship between the microbiome and appetite is not clearly defined, there is certainly a great deal of exciting [research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29037268/) that is being conducted to explore how insulin sensitivity and hormones, and other factors related to appetite management, are impacted by the microbiome as a whole—and how supplements such as probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics can be leveraged to help promote appetite control.

### Seed's Gut-Brain Development Program \[only use when there are specific questions about the program\]

On this note, you may be pleased to know that we launched a [Gut-Brain Development Program](https://seed.com/cultured/unlocking-new-potential-in-the-gut-brain-axis/)​ to develop microbial innovations for overall mental well-being. While the program is still under development, we hope to share more updates publicly soon\!

It’s important to acknowledge that this is a very new field of study and further clinical data is warranted to support probiotics as an efficacious treatment for anxiety, depression, and related mental health/psychological conditions.

Ultimately, while research continues to explore the gut-brain axis, further clinical trials are needed to better understand the impacts of probiotics and the gut microbiome on cognitive function.

## Are probiotics safe for long-term use?

While studies measuring the safety of long-term probiotic use are scarce, probiotics are [generally considered safe](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/gmic.1.3.12127) for healthy individuals. For context, probiotic organisms do not typically enter into systemic circulation and have not been known to reach levels of toxicity (read more in [this review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4490230/), and [this WGO guidance](https://www.worldgastroenterology.org/guidelines/probiotics-and-prebiotics/probiotics-and-prebiotics-english)).

With this said, it is important to understand that the safety of probiotics can depend upon various factors, including one’s health history, the duration of use, as well as the specific probiotic strain consumed. As such, we always advise those with pre-existing conditions to consult with their healthcare provider before adding any new supplement into their routine.

***\[Depending on the inquiry, consider including language from*** [\_Colonization of probiotics / transient nature \_](https://app.getguru.com/card/Tjkyq8rc/Colonization-of-probiotics-transient-nature-) */* [*Cycling / rotating probiotics /*](https://app.getguru.com/card/TkGgdAxc/Cycling-rotating-probiotics)\_ [*General Strain Specificity Education*](https://app.getguru.com/card/i55LKEoT/General-Strain-Specificity-Education)**\]**

## How do probiotic benefits show up in lab results? / How can I assess/measure what probiotics are doing for me?

Classic clinical endpoints—or indicators that probiotics are working—are typically the most visceral ones, including bowel movement regularity, stool consistency, and quality (measured using the [Bristol stool chart](https://seed.com/cultured/decoder-for-your-poop/)), as well as the improvement in other symptoms such as gas and occasional bloating.

Sometimes progress is less obvious, or more difficult to track outside of a lab or without access to appropriate diagnostic equipment.

Clinical markers can be assessed through at-home and/or in-person testing—including via blood, stool, urine, or standard questionnaires. For example, in clinical trials, researchers can use [lactulose/mannitol testing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6687120/) to assess intestinal permeability in response to an intervention ([probiotics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8834517/)). Lactulose absorption may represent gut damage (mucosal integrity), and mannitol absorption is used as a measure of normal small intestine function (nutrient uptake).

More generally, [metabolomic profiling](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9229737/) of stool samples is an example that could be used when assessing progress in your gastrointestinal health by examining what metabolites are present. This \-omics based approach is typically conducted in a lab setting, whereby fecal samples are stabilized in a solution, and then analyzed for microbiome data. Short Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) levels can also be measured via stool using a method known as [""LC/MS""](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/9/4/121), which contains a variation of [liquid chromatography](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43586-022-00175-x) (LC)—a complex method used in chemistry used to separate components from a mixture—and analyzed with a detection method like [mass spectrometry](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43586-022-00175-x) (MS) to identify and quantify the components.

Additionally, symptom severity scales are subjective measures of evaluating efficacy for an intervention and can be used to assess improvement. The [SCORAD index](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24035157/), for example, is one of the most validated scoring systems for atopic dermatitis (eczema). It assesses area, intensity and other objective symptoms.

These are just a select few examples of endpoints of interest in probiotic research—the potential is truly endless. That said, these sequencing and testing techniques are often not available outside of research settings.

Lastly, the state of research for [technologies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7598837/) to assess the microbiome (be it through blood, stool, or other collection methods) is burgeoning (and exciting), but has a long way to go before actionable advice can be gleaned from individual samples. This is why it's so important that for any product you take, the company is transparent about the clinical and mechanistic data used to support any benefit claims.

## Ophthalmic/Eye

While it has been historically [debated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7786018/) whether microorganisms are able to colonize the ocular surface due to the lacrimal gland producing lysozymes that can kill bacteria, studies have shown evidence of the existence of an ['ocular microbiome'](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23797046/)​.

Similar to how a dysbiotic gut microbiome can contribute to the development of various conditions of the GI tract, studies suggest that alterations to the ocular microbiome may be related to several ophthalmic diseases, such as [blepharitis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22836761/)​, [conjuctivitis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11328723/)​, [keratitis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5033354/), and [dry eye syndrome](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18055811/)​.

### More detail: Eye microbiome condition examples

For example,\_ Chlamydia trachomatis—\_the causative agent of trachoma, the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide—has been shown to be associated with [reduced bacterial diversity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25484919/)​ and an increase in certain types of bacteria seen in patients with conjunctival scarring. Interestingly, preliminary research indicates that [contact lens usage](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28114568/) ​alters the microbial structure of the ocular microbiome—one suggesting this shift may be [closer to the skin microbiome](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27006462/).

### Gut-Eye Axis Intro

Interestingly, there is emerging research on the 'gut-eye axis'—or, the connection between the gut microbiome and that of the eye. Included in this research is the study of whether dysbiosis of the gut microbiome may influence ocular diseases. In this [article](https://www.aao.org/eyenet/article/the-gut-and-the-eye)​ from the American Academy of Ophthalmology, researchers explore more about the potential relationship and studies surrounding this relationship.

### Eye conditions \+ Gut microbiome / inflammation

Interestingly, this [review​](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7942081/)​ suggests the importance of the gut microbiota in ocular inflammatory diseases such as uveitis, keratitis, and age-related macular degeneration. Moreover, studies are examining the gut microbiota's influence on complications of non-ocular eye concerns, such as [diabetic retinopathy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10352852/)​​ and [Graves' orbitopathy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8727912/)​.

### Oral Probiotic use

As these conditions may involve the gut-eye axis, the idea of probiotic use to support ophthalmic health has been considered.

One such [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9409742/)​ found probiotics may help with dry eye: as this condition is associated with inflammation, the gut microbiota modulation of inflammation may be one potential method to assist in the management of dry eyes. That said, another [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37256485/)​ found that oral probiotics were not effective for dry eye patients, while an eye drop containing a post-biotic (dead bacterial components) was effective in improving symptoms.

That said, it is important to note that while theses studies are promising, a majority of these studies are done *in vitro* or in mice and require further studies with human subjects to better understand the ocular microbiome and ophthalmic diseases before any firm conclusions can be drawn. Understanding of the commensal bacteria and their functions, causative agents of alterations to the microbiome structure, and the effects of addition or removal of certain bacteria are all important knowledge needed before moving towards therapeutics regarding the ocular microbiome. Therefore, as this field is relatively new and continuously evolving, more rigorous trials are needed to understand the role of probiotics and/or the gut microbiota in ophthalmic health and disease.

## MTHFR

To begin, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic and the strains included in our formula have not been studied specifically in individuals with the MTHFR gene mutations, so we would be unable to say for sure if the folate produced by the probiotic will directly effect the folate status of that population.

### MTHFR Mutations \+ Folate

However, it is notable to the case of MTHFR mutations that bacteria [produce](https://aem.asm.org/content/73/1/179) methylated folate, instead of the synthetic version, folic acid, which is in most supplements. A [2011 review](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2011.05157.x) of probiotic folate production cites research by [Lamers et al. 2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16825690?dopt=Abstract) in their statement: ""As natural folates, such as 5‐methyltetrahydrofolate (5‐MTHF) that is normally found in foods and sometimes produced by micro‐organisms do not mask B12 deficiency, this folate form would be a more efficient and secure alternative than supplementation with folic acid"".

### Folate Production by Probiotics

You may be interested in this [paper,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257725/#B17-nutrients-03-00118) which breaks down the biosynthesis of folate production by probiotic bacteria. In sum, the colon represents a major storehouse of folate, which is produced in large quantities by the colonic microbiota—mainly as monoglutamylated folate, the form that is generally absorbed at the highest rate. Some strains of [*Bifidobacterium*](https://aem.asm.org/content/73/1/179) and *Lactobacillus* genera are increasingly being studied for their beneficial ability to produce this important vitamin.

As this field grows, there should be more emerging research on whether bacterial-derived folate could be useful for those with MTHFR mutations. Further studies and rigorous clinical trials using a probiotic containing these folate-producing strains are needed before recommending probiotics as a therapy for those with MTHFR mutations.

As with any supplement, we recommend discussing with your healthcare provider on the inclusion and safety of DS-01® in your regimen. It may also be useful to discuss how it may affect and how to monitor your serum homocysteine and folate levels during supplementation.

## NSAIDs

There are no known contraindications between probiotics and medications; therefore, **\[DS-01®️ / PDS-08®️ Pediatric\] Daily Synbiotic** would be generally safe to take alongside any NSAIDs, **\[including ibuprofen,\]** or any prescription or over-the-counter medication(s).

### Short version:

For context, the effect of NSAID medications on the gut microbiome is just starting to be [studied](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26482265); at this time, research has not yet clearly established whether changes to the gut microbiome are directly caused by NSAIDs or whether these microbiome changes could be a result of the underlying condition that the NSAIDs are treating.

### Longer version:

NSAID-induced gut microbiome dysbiosis is relatively well [documented.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163725822002212) However, aside from the identification of the microbial signature changes associated with these medications, much less is known about the underlying mechanisms, as few studies have directly addressed the hypothesized potential contributors (namely, mucosal inflammation, changes in intestinal motility, luminal pH and bile acid metabolism, or direct drug-induced inhibitory effect on bacterial growth).

In short, the research has not established if the medications are causing changes in the gut microbiome, or if the underlying condition that the NSAIDs are treating results in said changes.

That said, there is some evidence to suggest that during and after NSAID use may be a good time for probiotics. This [review](https://karger.com/dig/article/95/1/22/116939/Microbiota-Plays-a-Key-Role-in-Non-Steroidal-Anti) explores how probiotics could be a useful tool to help modulate the composition of the intestinal microbiota as a new therapeutic strategy for NSAID-induced small intestinal damage.

Ultimately, we always recommend consulting with a prescribing physician regarding the combined utility of **\[DS-01®️ / PDS-08®️\]** and any medications in your routine, so they may advise with the complete knowledge of your health history and the specific medication.

## Does Pomegranate have any blood thinning effects? Can the pomegranate in DS-01® act as a blood thinner?

### the blood thinning / anticoagulant effects of pomegranate

To start, it's important to note that neither DS-01® Daily Synbiotic—nor its prebiotic component sourced from Indian pomegranate—have been been studied for their effects on blood thinning or anti-coagulation, and thus we are ultimately unable to comment on its effect in this regard.

However, I am certainly happy to share some information in regards to the scientific literature on pomegranate and its potential blood thinning properties.

Of note, there have been a few studies to suggest that pomegranate may contribute to blood thinning effects, though more clinical research is needed in this area before confirming this effect in humans.

For example, one [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022286024027042#:~:text=in%20the%20extract.-,P.,be%20responsible%20for%20these%20effects.) found that pomegranate peel extract exerted a significant preventive antithrombotic action (reduced risk of blood clots) in mice. The same study also found that the pomegranate extract demonstrated antiplatelet and anticoagulant actions in rats and *in vitro*—both of which decrease the clotting power of blood. Similar anti-coagulant effects were found in a [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26881853/), which gave pomegranate juice to rabbits.

Of note, it's important to keep in mind that these studies were conducted in animals and *in vitro* (e.g., in a ""test tube""), and more research is validate whether these potential blood thinning do in fact occur in people.

Next, in case you are currently taking a blood thinning medication, I did want to share... \[insert research from [Blood Thinners/Anticoagulants (Warfarin or DOAC/NOAC) card](https://app.getguru.com/card/ikMy8LRT/Blood-ThinnersAnticoagulants-Warfarin-or-DOACNOAC)\]

With this all in mind, if you have any specific concerns or questions about anything shared here, we do recommend chatting with your physician or pharmacist, who can best advise about the use of DS-01® with your unique health history in mind.

## Blood Thinners/Anticoagulants (Warfarin or DOAC/NOAC)

If needed, use this information with [Medications which may potentially interact with the prebiotic component (pomegranate) in DS-01®](https://app.getguru.com/card/TMXqXrac/Medications-which-may-potentially-interact-with-the-prebiotic-component-pomegranate-in-DS01-) , or [Does Pomegranate have any blood thinning effects? Can the pomegranate in DS-01® act as a blood thinner?](https://app.getguru.com/card/TGz5bG7c/Does-Pomegranate-have-any-blood-thinning-effects-Can-the-pomegranate-in-DS01-act-as-a-blood-thinner)

### Warfarin:

#### Pomegranate questions:

There is some early [research](https://dmd.aspetjournals.org/content/early/2006/11/28/dmd.106.011718) suggesting that pomegranate may affect a particular liver enzyme called Cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9), which aids the body in metabolizing specific drugs and compounds, such as warfarin (Coumadin)—a common blood thinning medication. This inhibitory activity of pomegranate on the CYP2C9 enzyme may impact the metabolism of warfarin—leading to the potential plasma drug concentration increase of warfarin in the body—in turn affecting INR levels.

That said, it is important to note that this study was conducted in rats, and additional review of this specific pomegranate-drug interaction in humans is warranted at this time.

Ultimately, since Warfarin has a narrow therapeutic window, and the [INR](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/arrhythmia/prevention--treatment-of-arrhythmia/a-patients-guide-to-taking-warfarin) levels are tightly monitored—it is prudent to exercise special caution and consult your health care provider when taking in conjunction with Warfarin or other medications/supplements, including DS-01®.

#### Vitamin K questions:

While natural chlorophyll is fat-soluble (and therefore may contain fat-soluble vitamins including vitamin K), the sodium copper chlorophyllin contained in DS-01® is a water-soluble form that contains negligible amounts of vitamin K (if any).\*\* \*\*

**\[optional—background on warfarin \+ vitamin K:** Vitamin K plays a large factor in warfarin activity as warfarin inhibits [vitamin K synthesis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470313/) to lower the amount of vitamin K, which then leads to reduced synthesis of clotting factors. Warfarin activity is most commonly measured by the International Normalized Ratio (INR)—a standardized way to present clotting time. A higher INR level indicates a longer clotting time, while a lower INR level indicates a shorter clotting time. \]

In addition, it's important to note that some microbial strains are known to [produce vitamin K](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3459241/), and this increased local production of vitamin K may lead to [decreased INR levels](https://jintensivecare.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40560-020-00517-5). This can be thought to have similar effects to when eating leafy green vegetables and other foods known to affect INR levels.

That said, since warfarin has a narrow therapeutic window, and the [INR](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/arrhythmia/prevention--treatment-of-arrhythmia/a-patients-guide-to-taking-warfarin) levels are tightly monitored—it is prudent to exercise special caution and consult your health care provider when taking in conjunction with other medications or supplements, including probiotics.

### Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs):

#### Also known as:

* NOAC \- Novel Oral Anticoagulant / Non-vitamin K Oral Anticoagulant  
    
* DOAC \- Direct / Direct-acting Oral Anticoagulant  
    
* TSOAC \- Target-Specific Oral Anticoagulant

#### Examples of DOACs— generic (brand)

* Rivaroxaban (Xarelto)  
    
* Apixaban (Eliquis)  
    
* Edoxaban (Lixiana)  
    
* Dabigatran (Pradaxa) — inhibits thrombin and not metabolized by CYP3A4

#### Vitamin K questions:

If your blood thinner is under the new class of **\[name member uses: DOAC/NOAC/TSOAC\]**, these anticoagulants work differently than warfarin and may not be affected by vitamin K.

For some background, warfarin works by disrupting synthesis of vitamin K which is a component of the clotting process (i.e. coagulation). These new anticoagulants do not follow this pathway, and instead directly inhibit a [clotting factor (factor Xa)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5851208/). For this reason, [research](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.021831) indicates vitamin K does not play a role in modulating the efficacy of these new anticoagulants.

#### Pomegranate questions:

Additionally, warfarin is mostly metabolized by the enzyme CYP2C9, which can be affected by grapefruit and pomegranate juice. Although DOACs can be metabolized by CYP2C9, DOACs are mostly metabolized by [CYP3A4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9308105/), a different enzyme which is also affected by grapefruit and pomegranate juice.

While grapefruit juice is known to affect both warfarin and DOACs, pomegranate juice effects are less known for DOACs. One review shows that [pomegranate juice](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10003857) *may* affect CYP3A4-mediated drugs, but this review did not account for DOACs. The [National Health Service](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/anticoagulants/considerations/) in the United Kingdom, the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/apixaban-oral-route/before-using/drg-20060729), [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/19106-apixaban-tablets), and [Poison Control](https://www.poison.org/articles/what-is-eliquis) do not list pomegranate as a potential interaction.

## Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS)

### EMAIL:

DS-01® has not been studied in those diagnosed with mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), so we cannot comment on any differences in effect within this population.

That said, regarding the research on probiotics as a whole, you may find this [review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682652/pdf/fncel-13-00345.pdf)​ interesting, which discussed the effect of many probiotic preparations—and found that probiotics may have a beneficial impact on mast cell signaling, and could potentially be effective at alleviating symptoms in individuals with MCAS.

You may also be interested in a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3042653/) which demonstrated that the probiotic strains *Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus* GG, *L. rhamnosus LC705*, *Propionibacterium freudenreichii* JS, and *Bifidobacterium lactis* Bb12 may potentially support the downregulation of IgE and histamine receptor genes, thereby potentially diminishing mast cell allergy-related activation.

**\[OPTIONAL ADD ON if asking about any negative effects from taking DS-01® w/ this disease:** Though we have not studied DS-01® in individuals with MCAS, we have conducted in vitro [testing](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13197-021-05327-7)​ on our product, which demonstrated that DS-01® strains do not raise [histamine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7463562/#B11-biomolecules-10-01181) under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions.

That said, as a company rooted in science, we often inform our members of the potential inability of in vitro results to replicate in real-world conditions, though producing efficient preliminary results.

With all of the above in mind, everyone has a unique physiology, and the responses to probiotics can and do vary. As such, it may be pertinent to consult with your personal physician, who can advise on your probiotic intake with complete knowledge of your health history in mind.\]

### SOCIAL:

DS-01® has not been studied in those diagnosed with mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), so we cannot comment on any differences in effect within this population. That said, regarding the research on probiotics as a whole, you may find a [recent review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682652/pdf/fncel-13-00345.pdf)​ interesting, which discussed the effect of many probiotic preparations and found that probiotics may have a beneficial impact on mast cell signaling and could potentially be effective at alleviating symptoms in individuals with MCAS.

## Birth Control / Contraception

### General contraindication language \+ disclaimers

There are no known or studied contraindications between DS-01® and prescription or over-the-counter medications, so it would generally be safe to take our product alongside the oral contraceptive (OC) pill or other forms of birth control.

Further, while DS-01® has not been studied specifically for its impact on birth control, probiotics in general have not been shown to affect the function of birth control.

### BC \+ Probiotics (general / basic)

Birth control [may have](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4752384/) an impact on the structure and function of the microbiota, though less is known about its impact on the viability or efficacy of oral probiotics.

### BC \+ Microbiome

The vagina is home to a fascinating microbial environment \+ one that must contend with and protect itself from everything that may predispose it to infection—from menstrual products and contraceptives to human contact.

Oral contraceptives could potentially impact overall gut health—for example, estrogens found in oral contraceptives have been [shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4752384/) to modify intestinal permeability, which could contribute to intestinal hyperpermeability (i.e., “leaky gut”), and/or the development of inflammatory bowel diseases.

Exogenous hormone use could also impact the levels of other circulating hormones (i.e., androgens), which may enhance the development of certain inflammatory markers active in the gut. Some [data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4752384/) suggests that the microbiome itself plays a role in the metabolism of androgens, so there is evidence to suggest that there may be a connection between birth control use, the microbiome, and immunity—all of which acting together affect gut health.

\[Impact to vaginal microbiome: There's likely a [connection](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7511578/) between the vaginal and gut microbiomes; however, this link is not yet entirely clear. \]

### Probiotics \+ menstrual cycle symptoms in women taking BC

Interestingly, this [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35689274/) appears to be one of the first of its kind, seeking to explore whether probiotics are effective in decreasing gastrointestinal symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle in healthy adult women taking oral contraceptives. That said, more clinical research is needed to further understand any potential effects.

**\[Optional:** This in mind, while it is generally considered safe to consume probiotics and oral contraceptives at the same time, one could posit that probiotic consumption may support overall gastrointestinal health, thus supporting an improved quality of life in oral contraceptive users who experience uncomfortable GI symptoms that accompany their menstrual cycle.

Of note, it's important to keep in mind that probiotic benefits are strain-specific.\]

All said, we will always defer to the medical advice of your prescribing physician concerning your medication and probiotic routine, who can best advise under the knowledge of your personal health history.

## L-Glutamine

### Basic Glutamine \+ Gut Health

Interestingly, [research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213453021000112#:~:text=Recent%20research%20has%20shown%20that,and%20by%20modulating%20inflammatory%20responses.)​ does support the amino acid glutamine's positive impact on gut health by supporting the [gut microbiome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6834172/)​, [gut mucosal wall integrity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4369670/#:~:text=Hence%20Glutamine%20is%20an%20essential,mucosal%20epithelial%20tight%20junction%20integrity.)​, and [modulation of inflammatory responses.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213453021000112)​

## Chemotherapy

**SciCare:** Note that a majority of instances in which this information will be utilized within the queue will be in discussions with members who have received a cancer diagnosis. With this in mind, these responses should be built with careful attention to tone–altering to inject empathy and care throughout.

### Basic / Contraindication \+ disclaimer language

There are no known contraindications between probiotics and medications; therefore, **\[DS-01®/PDS-08® Pediatric\]** Daily Synbiotic would be generally safe to take alongside any prescription or over-the-counter medication(s).

That said, it’s important to note that **\[DS-01®/PDS-08®\]** has not been studied in individuals with cancer, or those who have undergone any form of chemotherapy or other cancer treatment, so we cannot comment directly on any possible differences in effect or specific safety data in these populations.

We would recommend that patients consult their oncologist or physician when considering adding any new product or supplement (including ours) to their routine, so that the physician may advise within the context of each individual's health history.

### Diet's impact on diarrhea in chemo patients

[One study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9100930/)​ found an association with low levels of Vitamin D and increased severity of diarrhea in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. This study also found patients who adhered to the Mediterranean diet also had a lower incidence of diarrhea during chemotherapy.

### Chemo GI symptoms

#### Short version:

Chemotherapy is a known microbiome disruptor that affects the microbial environment in several ways. For example, diarrhea is a common and often poorly-managed side effect of chemotherapy treatment.

#### Long version:

Though the microbiome’s role in the practice of oncology is still evolving, several [studies](https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2021.706331) suggest that chemotherapy, along with [antibiotics](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6382/10/2/152) and [radiation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9824372/#:~:text=As%20one%20of%20these%20many,)%20%5B57%2C58%5D.), could result in dysbiosis for cancer patients. For example, a recent cross-sectional pilot [study](https://www.mdpi.com/1718-7729/29/5/243) found that young adult cancer survivors may demonstrate long-term gut microbial dysbiosis and more severe GI symptoms (i.e., gastrointestinal discomfort, gas, bloating, constipation, or diarrhea) post-chemotherapy, which may also be associated with psychosocial symptoms.

### Probiotics \+ Chemo symptoms

#### Short version:\*\* \*\*

While generally understudied in regards to cancer, probiotics may provide support for chemotherapy-associated gastrointestinal distress such as [diarrhea](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24618152/)—particularly in the case of cancers affecting the GI tract and colon.

#### Longer version:

Some of the most promising outcomes for probiotics in the oncology field center around their alleviation of [chemotherapy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24618152/)\- and [radiotherapy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5456391/)\-induced diarrhea.

A recent [review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6247548/) of clinical studies that used probiotics and other adjunct treatments to chemotherapy showed that probiotics were reported to reduce the burden of treatment-induced intestinal mucositis and diarrhea.

All said, [reviews](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6513393/) emphasize the [low certainty](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/abs/effect-of-probiotic-supplementation-on-chemotherapy-and-radiotherapyrelated-diarrhoea-in-patients-with-cancer-an-umbrella-review-of-systematic-reviews-and-metaanalyses/C48BBAD35607EF56A8C7F3128CBA6846) of these conclusions and call for larger, more rigorous trials.

## Spore-based probiotics

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

Spore-based or spore-forming probiotics are soil-based microorganisms which are formed from spores found in dirt and vegetation. While most traditional probiotic strains—such as those included in DS-01® from the *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium* genera—are similar to those naturally found in the human gastrointestinal tract, spore-based probiotics are derived from other species and are delivered as dormant/inactive spores.

Interestingly, some preliminary scientific [research](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2020.01010/full) supports the potential benefits of certain soil-based or spore-forming bacteria in human probiotic products. The most commonly studied strains are soil-based microbes from the Bacillus genus, including strains from the species *Bacillus coagulans*, *Bacillus subtilis*, and *Bacillus clausii*.

While there is promising [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5554123/) surrounding spore-forming probiotics, further clinical studies should be performed to examine specific bacterial strains and blends in relation to widespread benefits within a heterogeneous population.

Additionally, data surrounding potential safety concerns—such as bacteremia in immunocompromised patients, as raised in [this 2017 review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5554123/)—should be further investigated on a strain-by-strain basis.

### Version 2 (deeper explanation)

**\[*SciCare note: The introduction of [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963996921005755) has a nice overview of the benefits of spore-based probiotics for a deeper dive\]***

There is preliminary but growing [scientific](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2020.01010/full) and clinical research to support the benefit of certain soil-based or spore-forming bacteria for implementation in human probiotic products. The most commonly studied strains are soil-based microbes from the *Bacillus* genus, including strains from the species *Bacillus coagulans*, *Bacillus subtilis*, and *Bacillus clausii*.

Spore-forming species and strains have been studied in several specific populations. For example, a pilot [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6034030/) on *Bacillus coagulans* MTCC 5856 has shown promise for prevention of depression in patients with IBS. In addition, results of a 2014 [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4129566/) indicated that supplementation of *Bacillus coagulans* improved abdominal pain and diarrhea in IBS patients, although the specific strain of *Bacillus coagulans* was not specified.

Further, an *in vitro* [analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9880548/) of the strain *Bacillus subtilis* DE111® explored its ability to survive harsh gastric transit, in addition to its metabolic activities, which have the potential to confer health benefits to the host. Importantly, however, this study was not performed on humans, meaning the results are not necessarily transferable. Spore-based probiotics contain soil-based/spore-forming microorganisms that are found naturally in soil and vegetation. **\[Potential add:** If the supplement contains strains of the *Bacillus* genus, it’s usually a spore-based probiotic\!**\]**

While there is promising [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5554123/) surrounding spore-forming probiotics, further clinical studies should be performed to examine specific bacterial strains and blends in relation to widespread benefits within a heterogeneous population.

Additionally, data surrounding potential safety concerns—such as bacteremia in immunocompromised patients, as raised in [this 2017 review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5554123/)—should be further investigated on a strain-by-strain basis.

## Fiber-based supplements

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

There are no known or studied contraindications between DS-01® Daily Synbiotic and other supplements; therefore, taking DS-01® alongside a fiber-based supplement, such as **\[supplement name\]**, would generally be safe.

For some context, DS-01® only contains a very small amount of fiber (\<200 mg/day) through the organic rice fiber included in our formulation. As such, DS-01® is not intended to negate or reduce the need for fiber, and fiber supplementation is not expected to remove DS-01®’s positive effects.

Still, it may also be pertinent to consult with your physician, who can advise on the entirety of your supplement routine with your complete health history in mind.

### Version 2 (deeper explanation)

There are no known or studied contraindications between DS-01® Daily Synbiotic and other supplements; therefore, taking DS-01® alongside a fiber-based supplement, such as **\[supplement name\]**, would generally be safe.

For some context, DS-01® only contains a very small amount of fiber (\<200 mg/day) through the organic rice fiber included to prevent the clumping of the powdered probiotic components during manufacturing. As such, DS-01® is not intended to negate or reduce the need for fiber, and fiber supplementation is not expected to remove DS-01®’s positive effects.

For reference, the National Institute of Health [recommends](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9268622/) a daily fiber intake of 25 grams for women and 38 grams for men.

That said, the concurrent intake of probiotics and soluble fibers, such as inulin, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), pectin, and psyllium may lead to heightened fermentation by probiotic bacteria, potentially causing gastrointestinal upset in [some individuals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9116469/). Therefore, it may be prudent to space out your intake of DS-01® and your fiber supplement (e.g., DS-01® in the morning and the fiber supplement in the evening). It may also be pertinent to consult with your physician, who can advise on the entirety of your supplement routine with your complete health history in mind.

**\[OPTIONAL ADD ON for Why do I need a prebiotic/synbiotic product if I supplement fiber?:** There are different types of prebiotics with different mechanistic functions. For example, fermenting fibers like inulin and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) “[feed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3705355/)” microbes and encourage growth. By contrast, our Microbiota-Accessible Polyphenolic Precursor \[MAPP\] introduces plant-based, non-fermenting prebiotic compounds called punicalagins, which neither inhibit nor support the growth of resident microbes. Instead, they extend their [benefits](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36431201/) as gut microbes biotransform them into metabolites—that is, beneficial and bioactive molecules often used systemically. Therefore, consuming a variety of prebiotic compounds offers an array of benefits and spurs various microbial functions.**\]**

## Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)

### NOTE:

**Reminder** to include appropriate regulatory compliance product disclaimers with research card information.

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

Although a relatively new field of study, there is research on the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the brain—known as the “gut-brain axis”—whereby the two can influence each other through biochemical signaling. This axis has most notably been connected to [cognition and mood disorders](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6469458/).

Interestingly, [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10419219/)​ suggests disruptions to the gut microbiome (i.e. dysbiosis) may play a role in the pathogenesis of OCD, possibly through the gut-brain axis. For this reason, there are emerging studies examining the potential therapeutic value of probiotics on OCD.

In addition, one [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24257436/)​ using an *in vitro* mouse model found probiotic strain, *Lactobacillus rhamnosus* GG, led to reduction of OCD-like behavior comparable to fluoxentine (a common medication prescribed for OCD). Another *in vitro* [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32124236/)​ found similar results with a different strain, *Lactobacillus casei* Shirota, where probiotic treatment modulated genetic markers of OCD, possibly through serotonin-related genes.

However, a caveat with *in vitro* testing is that, despite the ability to produce efficient preliminary results, these studies often fail to replicate the conditions of a human body. Unfortunately, there is a lack of clinical trials in humans to assess the effect of probiotics on OCD symptoms. Therefore, though the link between the [gut microbiome and OCD](https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/looking-into-the-gut-microbiome-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder-)​ have been found in multiple *in vitro* studies, trials in humans are required to assess if probiotics can be an adequate treatment for OCD.

## Vitamin B12, Folate

### DS-01® Relationship to folate/b12

Select strains in DS-01® may support an increase in the production of the essential micronutrient folate, and may produce biologically relevant levels of vitamin B12 based on *in vitro* studies.

For additional context, *Limosilactobacillus reuteri* SD-LRE2-IT, a strain in our formula, has been [**evaluated**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8431588/) in *in vitro* conditions to produce vitamin B12—a process that cannot be performed by plants or animals independently.

It is important to note that, while the results from this study have only been demonstrated in *""test tube""* models to date, *L. reuteri* SD-LRE2-IT shows promise of surviving throughout GI transit for arrival to the ileum (the area of the intestines where B12 is absorbed). Thus, our researchers plan to conduct further studies aimed to assess and validate DS-01®'s ability to positively improve vitamin B12 status in humans.

On a related note, the strain B. adolescentis SD-BA5-IT (also known in the literature as B. adolescentis DSM 18350), can metabolize B vitamins found in their natural form (think: folate in leafy greens) into a form that is usable by the human host, known as folic acid. In so doing, these strains [may support](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18685499) uptake of this essential micronutrient.

### If asking if DS-01® can replace their b12 and folate supplements?

To clarify, DS-01® is not formulated with B12 or folate. For reference, you can view our complete strain and ingredient list [here](https://seed.com/reference#label-101)​.

\[insert relevant verbiage from above\]

Regarding whether you should continue taking your B vitamins, of note, we do not know for certain the amount of B12 or folate that may be conferred by taking DS-01®, and thus we can't say for sure whether it would be sufficient to replace your current B vitamin intake.

This in mind, I can share that there are no known contraindications between probiotics and other dietary supplements; therefore, DS-01® should be fine to combine with supplements, such as B12 and folate.

All said, we would suggest consulting with your health care provider if you have any specific questions relating to DS-01® use in the context of your current supplement routine.

\[OPTIONAL if concerned about safety / having excess B vitamins—For some reassurance, B12 is water-soluble, and is generally considered [safe](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/)​, even at high doses (as any excess is excreted in the urine). For [folate](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Folate-Consumer/)​, the daily upper limit is 1,000 mcg for healthy adults.\]

### Anemia / Iron Deficiency

#### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

Kindly note that DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been examined in patients with\*\* \[low iron levels / iron deficiency anemia/ in the context of iron absorption\]\*\* ; thus, we cannot comment on effects in this regard. However, I'm glad to share information about this topic from scientific literature\!

For some background, dietary iron is usually in the non-bioavailable (ferric) form, and needs to be converted to the bioavailable (ferrous) form in order to be used by cells. One possible mechanism for this involves reducing the pH from neutral to acidic to allow for the [natural conversion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448204/)​ from ferric to ferrous form.

[Lactic acid](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16869994/)​ produced by lactic acid bacteria can help with this process through organic reduction of the pH necessary for the ferrous form, or by excreting [molecules](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28317737/) that help with the ferric to ferrous form conversion. Additionally, systemic [inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6949908/) is suspected of contributing to suboptimal iron uptake. Therefore, some you may find in probiotic products have been associated with increasing iron absorption, possibly through various [mechanisms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6949908/) that influence anti-inflammatory responses, enhance iron uptake, or increase ferrous iron bioavailability.

All this in mind, based on scientific literature, probiotic bacteria may be more beneficial than harmful for iron deficiency; however, as mentioned above, more studies and trials are needed to properly establish the dosage, timing, and method of intake to conclusively determine *if* a strain confers beneficial effects—as benefits are strain-specific and dose dependent.

#### Version 2 (deeper explanation)

[Lactic acid](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16869994/)​ produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) can help with this process by organically reducing the pH necessary for the ferrous form. Other molecules created by LAB can also help—for example, [*Lactobacillus fermentum*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28317737/)​ has been studied to increase iron bioavailability by excreting a molecule that helps with the ferric to ferrous form conversion.

Additionally, other bacteria have been associated with increasing iron absorption. *Lactobacillus plantarum* 299v was noted to improve iron deficiency when given together with [Vitamin C](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29353864/)​, [with a meal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5728536/)​, or with a rich source of iron like [pearl millet](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5728536/)​. A [systematic review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6949908/)​ noted this strain may be able to increase iron absorption through various mechanisms that influence anti-inflammatory responses, enhancing iron uptake, or increasing ferrous iron bioavailability.

All this in mind, based on scientific literature, probiotic bacteria may be more beneficial than harmful for iron deficiency; however, as mentioned above, more studies and trials are needed to properly establish the dosage, timing, and method of intake to conclusively determine *if* a strain confers beneficial effects—as benefits are strain-specific and dose dependent.

However, I'm glad to share information about this topic from scientific literature\!

Interestingly, there is [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4594053/)​ suggesting that probiotic bacteria could help with the bioavailability of iron (i.e. how much iron is available in your body). Majority of the research regarding probiotics and iron bioavailability focus on lactic acid bacteria (LAB) such as the *Lactobacillus* species.

For some background, dietary iron is usually in the non-bioavailable (ferric) form, and needs to be converted to the bioavailable (ferrous) form in order to be used by cells. One possible mechanism for this involves reducing the pH from neutral to acidic to allow for the [natural conversion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448204/)​ from ferric to ferrous form.

Additionally, one particular strain has been used in multiple studies conducted regarding iron-deficiency anemia (IDA). *Lactobacillus plantarum* 299v was noted to improve iron deficiency when given together with [Vitamin C](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29353864/)​, [with a meal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5728536/)​, or with a rich source of iron like [pearl millet](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5728536/)​. A [systematic review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6949908/)​ noted this strain may be able to increase iron absorption through various mechanisms that influence anti-inflammatory responses, enhancing iron uptake, or increasing ferrous iron bioavailability.

However, aside from *L. plantarum* 299v, other probiotic strains have not been thoroughly considered in clinical trials. Even with this strain, more studies and trials are needed to properly establish the dosage, timing, and method of intake to confer beneficial effects. Please note our synbiotic does not contain this specific strain—benefits are strain-specific and dose dependent\!

All this in mind, based on scientific literature, probiotic bacteria may be more beneficial than harmful for iron deficiency; however, as mentioned above, more studies and trials are needed to properly establish the dosage, timing, and method of intake to conclusively determine *if* a strain confers beneficial effects—as benefits are strain-specific and dose dependent.

**\[OPTIONAL—if asked about vitamin B12/B9 \+ iron:**

Vitamin B is essential for our health: it is known that the lack of [Vitamin B](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamin-b12-or-folate-deficiency-anaemia/)​—Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) and B9 (folate) in particular—is associated with anemia. The human body itself cannot produce [B12](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29216732/)​ or [B9,](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27008500/) and needs to get these vitamins from either food or our gut bacteria. Probiotic bacteria, such as those in the *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium* genera, are known to be avid producers of vitamins, especially [B vitamins](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21933312/)​, and therefore, probiotic bacteria that produce these vitamins may help with anemia.

On a related note, the strain *Bifidobacterium adolescenti*s SD-BA5-IT (also known in the literature as *B. adolescentis* DSM 18350), can metabolize B vitamins found in their natural form (think: folate in leafy greens) into a form that is usable by the human host, known as folic acid. In so doing, these strains [may support](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18685499) uptake of this essential micronutrient.

Similarly, another strain—*Limosilactobacillus reuteri* SD-LRE2-IT—has been [shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8431588/) in *in vitro* conditions to produce vitamin B12—a process that cannot be performed by plants or animals independently. However, it is important to note that the results from this study have only been demonstrated in *""test tube""* models to date. However, our proprietary capsule-in-capsule delivery technology, ViaCap®, shows promise of enabling strains to survive throughout GI transit for arrival to the ileum (the area of the intestines where B12 is absorbed).

Of note, further studies will be helpful to assess and validate probiotic impact on vitamin B12 status in humans. \]

## Cerebral Palsy

### E-mail / Private

Kindly note, \[PDS-08® Pediatric Daily Synbiotic / DS-01® Daily Synbiotic\] has not been studied in individuals living with cerebral palsy, so we are unable to comment on any difference in effect or utility in this population.

Ultimately, we always defer to the individual’s doctor when considering whether or not to add \[PDS-08®/DS-01®\] to their routine.

This in mind, I’d be happy to share with you some of the current research surrounding cerebral palsy, the gut microbiome, and probiotics, if it would be helpful for you.

*Insert 1 or more of relevant research topics below*

**\[Optional technical/practitioner closing:** For a more detailed narrative review of the studies to date on cerebral palsy, the gut microbiome, and pre/pro/synbiotics, I also recommend [Probiotics, Prebiotics, and Synbiotics on Constipation in Children with Cerebral Palsy](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/1156111). \]

### Cerebral palsy and constipation

It is [not uncommon](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20497454/) for individuals with [cerebral palsy (CP)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538147/) experience constipation—in fact, this is one of the [leading causes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30350531/) of hospitalization in children with CP. Many [CP-related factors](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/1156111) can contribute to this constipation, including but not limited to [difficulty swallowing](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dmcn.14316), low or excessive muscle tone, differences in [neurological control](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20497454/) of the gastrointestinal tract, use of [anticonvulsants](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31646147/), and reduced mobility.

### Cerebral palsy and gut microbiome

Given the emerging research on the [gut-brain-microbiome axis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-020-00460-0) and how gut dysbiosis may contribute to or be associated with various neurological disorders, it has also been hypothesized that dysbiosis may be associated with CP and CP-associated constipation as well.

Of note, [one study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31646147/) in children with cerebral palsy and epilepsy (CPE—epilepsy is a frequent comorbidity with CP) found that those with CPE had a more diverse gut microbiome than healthy children. The microbiome composition and abundance of certain taxa also significantly differed between children with and without CPE, as did the [microbial pathways](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36923492/) available for the degradation or production of certain metabolites.

However, although CP gut microbiomes differ from those of healthy children across [multiple studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S038776042030276X), the exact differences in community structure vary with different study populations and [methodologies](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pediatrics/articles/10.3389/fped.2022.1001789/full).

### cerebral palsy and probiotics

Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics have also been proposed as a means of alleviating some of the symptoms associated with CP—in particular, constipation. Two studies in [rat models of CP](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10839280/) found that CP itself had more of an effect on the gut microbiome than probiotics did. Although probiotics slowed the inflammatory response over time and improved measures of neuromotor and digestive health, improvements in mood and cognition were [inconsistent](https://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12868-021-00679-4) between the two studies.

Only two rigorous studies of probiotics and prebiotics have been conducted in children with CP to date. In [one study,](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pediatrics/articles/10.3389/fped.2022.1001789/full) a combination of a multi-strain probiotic and fiber improved multiple markers of constipation and increased gut microbiome diversity in children with CP, regardless of whether the children received a liquid or “standard” diet. To tease apart the impacts of probiotics vs. prebiotics, [another study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32998471/) gave children with CP a probiotic (*Lactobacillus reuteri* DSM 17938), a prebiotic (agave inulin), probiotic+prebiotic, or a placebo. Interestingly, probiotics decreased the stool pH and increased the frequency of spontaneous bowel movements, while the prebiotics decreased the frequency of hard stools and increased the frequency of hard stools; however, these effects were not seen in the synbiotic.

Although these initial findings are promising, it should also be noted that every study thus far has used different probiotics and different prebiotics, and that most sample sizes are fairly small. Many more rigorous clinical studies are therefore needed to determine whether probiotics, prebiotics, or both could be an effective intervention for CP-associated symptoms––and if so, which strains and dosages would be best, and for which symptoms.

## Seborrheic Dermatitis

### NOTE:

**SciCare Note:** Reminder to include appropriate R+C disclaimers in member responses when using information from research cards.

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

Fungal and [bacterial​](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27172459/)​ species in the [skin microbiome](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/exd.14450)​ play a role in seborrheic dermatitis (SD) and dandruff. Currently, more research needs to be done to understand the relationship between probiotics and SD or dandruff.

One [clinical trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28789559/)​ found a strain, *Lactobacillus paracasei* NCC 2461 ST11, was able to reduce symptoms and severity of dandruff, albeit in healthy (non-SD) volunteers. Another [trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10834955/)​ using *L. crispatus* P17631 and *L. paracasei* I1688 found decreases in *Malassezia* (main fungal species involved in SD) and reductions in SD severity index scoring.

However, it is important to note that the majority of such studies use [*topical*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8955881/)​ probiotics (suspensions/creams) for SD or dandruff treatment to potentially directly modulate and affect the skin microbiome.

This all in mind, further studies and clinical trials are needed to better assess the strains and dosages needed, the route of administration, and the composition of the probiotic (i.e. cream vs oil) on efficacy of treating SD patients.

## Yeast infections

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

While VS-01™ promotes a healthy yeast balance, we have not clinically evaluated VS-01™ with respect to impact on any diseases or conditions; therefore we cannot make any claims related to yeast infections.

As far as the literature landscape is concerned, you may be interested to know that certain strains of probiotics are increasingly being studied for their [benefits](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2662373/) to vaginal health, including the relationship between probiotics, the vaginal microbiome, and vaginal yeast imbalances.

Interestingly, vaginal microbiomes dominated by certain protective strains are associated with decreased risk of some states of dysbiosis, including vulvovaginal candidiasis (Candida fungal infections).

\[For information about oral probiotic impact / 'gut-vagina axis':

There has been compelling research to show that some ‘disruptive’ vaginal organisms additionally have a reservoir in the gut. Therefore, while oral probiotics will not migrate to the vagina, they may still have the ability to [impact](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9366906/)​ vaginal communities (particularly Candida—known to be the cause of most yeast infections, and the causative organisms involved in bacterial vaginosis). \]

All said, probiotics are considered safe for use in most individuals. However, we always suggest an informed conversation with a primary care provider who may advise on the addition of VS-01™ given your unique health history.

### Version 3 (deepest \+ most scientific)

Kindly note that VS-01™ Vaginal Synbiotic is not intended to treat, prevent, or cure any condition or disease state. Further, we have not specifically studied VS-01™ in a population living with vaginal yeast infections, and thus, are unable to comment on any difference in effect, utility or safety in this regard. Therefore, we would suggest consulting with your physician who can appropriately advise on the use of this product with knowledge of your complete health history.

Rather, VS-01™ is the first synbiotic clinically proven to restore a healthy vaginal microbiome and sustain regulated vaginal pH, safe for long-term use. Developed from 15+ years of breakthrough research, VS-01™ is the first vaginal synbiotic formulated with three proprietary strains of *L. crispatus* identified from over 600 candidates for their unmatched efficacy in promoting vaginal health. Our first-of-its-kind synbiotic suppository combines these strains with a rich complex of nutrients and molecules to create the ideal environment and energy source for the probiotic strains to thrive—addressing gynecological health at the source to protect and defend against disruption.

That said, as far as the literature landscape is concerned, you may be interested to know that [some studies](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2023.1123026/full#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20researchers%20have%20conducted%20several,of%20VVC%20and%20treat%20VVC.) suggest that vaginal colonization of probiotics—especially from the genus *Lactobacillus*—can effectively reduce the risk of vaginal candidiasis (or vaginal yeast infection).

[Vulvovaginal candidiasis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459317/) (VVC) is a fungal infection which occurs when *Candida albicans*, a pathogenic yeast, is able to successfully colonize the vaginal tract. The result can include inflammation, itching, and discharge, among other symptoms. Lactobacilli are thought to prevent this colonization and overgrowth by excreting metabolic by-products and acidifying the vaginal environment ( the normal vaginal pH value for a woman of reproductive age can range from [3.8 to 5.0](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15838694/))—as the organic acids, hydrogen peroxides, bacteriocins and biosurfactants they produce have been [demonstrated](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.00564/full) to strongly inhibit *C. albicans* growth.

Interestingly, as there is no direct physiological path for microbes to travel from the GI tract/colon to the vagina, delivery mechanisms of such protective bacteria may matter. There has been compelling research to show that some ‘disruptive’ vaginal organisms have a reservoir in the gut—so, while oral probiotics will not migrate to the vagina but [can impact](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9366906/)​ vaginal communities (particularly *Candida*, the causative agent of most yeast infections), promising research suggests that because vaginally administered probiotics ensure maximal contact with vaginal epithelial cells (enabling beneficial changes to the vaginal microbiome), direct vaginal administration could be a strategy to help restore a healthy vaginal microbiome and sustain regulated vaginal pH in a way that is safe for use in the long term.

That said, one [systematic review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31299136/) found probiotic supplementation for VVC led to mixed results: while some individuals did not show significant differences compared to placebo, some had reduced recurrence when used in conjunction with antifungal treatment. Another [systematic review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11111202/) presented a similar conclusion—probiotics did not reduce clinical symptoms nor incidence of VVC; however, they did help with reducing recurrence. Of note, while most of the research thus far has looked at oral\_ Lactobacillus\_ supplementation, one [study](https://brill.com/view/journals/bm/14/2/article-p143_5.xml?Tab%20Menu=article) found both oral and vaginal capsules reduced symptoms in VVC patients compared to the placebo group. Vaginal capsules presented more improvement in itching/irritation than oral capsules; on the other hand, oral capsules presented more improvement in discharge levels. With more research still needed, ultimately, the therapeutic effect of probiotics will likely vary with the administration route and dosage of probiotics. In sum, while promising, use of probiotics for VVC treatment or prevention is still not well understood. More rigorous trials are needed to assess the types of strains, dosages, and the mode of administration that would be most effective for VVC.

If you’re curious to learn more about vaginal health research, vaginal conditions, and our journey to developing VS-01™, check out our Cultured [Vaginal Microbiome](https://seed.com/cultured/category/vaginal-microbiome/) section.

All said, while I do hope I provided helpful supplementary information on the field of probiotics and yeast infections, as well as some useful information to better explain the use for and limitations of our product, research in the field is developing. In addition, it’s important to take note of differences in trial design, probiotic strains used and other ingredients, dosage, and delivery mechanism, as each may contribute to outcome variance across a similar population. We encourage you to work with your physician to determine your optimal health and wellness protocol.

## Bariatric Surgery / Gastrectomy

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

Kindly note, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied in individuals who have undergone bariatric surgery,\*\* \[including Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy (VSG) or Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG) / gastric bypass or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB)\]\*\* ; therefore, we are unable to comment on any difference in effect or utility with this population.

For some additional context, contents remain in the stomach for about [2 hours](https://seed.com/cultured/an-at-home-experiment-to-measure-your-transit-time-and-what-it-can-tell-you-about-your-gut-health/)​ after eating before moving to the small intestine.

However, [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6776718/)​ suggests bariatric surgery may lead to an accelerated gastric emptying rate (the time it takes for food to leave your stomach). Additionally, [sleeve gastrectomy](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11695-021-05308-x) and [gastric bypass/RYGB](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11695-021-05308-x) are known to affect gastrointestinal motility—and it's possible that changes to gastric emptying rate and gastrointestinal motility may affect the efficacy of DS-01®. Of note, the capsule could be ejected too quickly and possibly appear in the stool partially intact, meaning that the probiotic strains may not be adequately delivered to the colon.

With this in mind, we would ultimately recommend consulting with your physician before adding DS-01® to your routine. You may also want to discuss with them whether it would be advisable to take one capsule for the first week or so and check your stool for any remnants of the capsules before increasing to the full recommended dosage of 2 capsules/day.

### Version 2 (deeper explanation)

Kindly note, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied in individuals who have undergone bariatric surgery,\*\* \[including Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy (VSG) or Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG) / gastric bypass or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB)\]\*\* ; therefore, we are unable to comment on any difference in effect or utility with this population.

That said, I'd be happy to share the current research perspective on probiotics following bariatric surgery.

Research has recently identified the gut microbiome as one of many potential interacting factors that may contribute to [weight modulation](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9157685/)​. In addition to physiological changes, bariatric surgery can change the gut microbiome as well, though these [microbiome changes](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9157685/)​ vary by study setup and by the type of bariatric surgery performed.

Probiotics have also been proposed as a means of improving bariatric surgery outcomes and recovery. One [meta-analysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-023-01375-5) found that in patients with morbid obesity, probiotic supplementation after bariatric surgery prompted increases in B12 and certain measures of liver health, as well as decreases in triglycerides, weight, and appetite factors. That said, another [systematic review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667008922000234)​ found probiotics improved lipid and glycemic profiles following bariatric surgery, but not body measures (such as weight). Interestingly, these efficacy of probiotics appears to vary by the type of surgery performed, with more marked benefits following [Roux-en-Y bypass](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10078542)​.

Though these studies are promising, more rigorous clinical trials are therefore needed to understand the effects of administering certain probiotic strains following specific types of bariatric surgery.

## Why should I take probiotics if my digestion is fine? / Benefits of probiotics if already “healthy” (diet or otherwise)

### microbiome impact \+ disruption overview

Research indicates that the health of your [gut microbiome](https://seed.com/cultured/microbiome-101/) is critical not only to your digestive health, but to the health of most of your body—the gut microbiome has been connected to almost [all components](https://asm.org/articles/2023/january/gut-microbiome-communication-the-gut-organ-axis#:~:text=Neurologically%20active%20compounds%20produced%20by,serotonin%20levels%20in%20the%20brain.) of your body. From your skin to your heart, from your immune system to your brain, a healthy gut microbiome is a major key in systemic health, and [dysbiosis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-022-00974-4) (disruption) of the gut microbiome has been shown to be connected to many systemic diseases.

Unfortunately, a variety of factors associated with modern living may disturb the balance of your gut microbiome—including [antibiotic overuse](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33330122/), [alcohol](https://seed.com/cultured/how-alcohol-damages-your-microbiome/), [tobacco](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8245763/), [disrupted sleep](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6779243/), [stress](https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-022-06066-4), and [poor diet](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7230850/), among others. These factors may encourage microbial dysbiosis, leading to [poor health outcomes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8218903/#:~:text=Dysbiosis%2C%20as%20defined%20above%2C%20is,35).

And while it is certainly true that dietary intervention has been [shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9455721/) to have beneficial effects for both developing and maintaining a diverse or ‘healthy’ microbiome, sometimes your microbiome may require a little extra support\!

That’s where probiotics such as DS-01® Daily Synbiotic come in, as they can provide support for your gut microbiome in a variety of ways–[for example](https://seed.com/reference/syn-wk), by producing beneficial metabolites, like short chain fatty acids, or supporting gut barrier integrity.

Thus, while we do not believe health is contained in a single pill or supplement, we do believe that probiotics and prebiotics—alongside important lifestyle factors such as nutrition, exercise and sleep—can support your gut microbiome to achieve foundational, systemic health.

### GALT / Gut Barrier Integrity / SCFAs

Fun fact—Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue ([**GALT**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18721321/)) is known as the “largest immune organ” in the body as it represents about 70% of the entire immune system\! This interplay between the immune system and the gut is known as the 'gut-immune axis'. And at the interface of this interaction is the [gut barrier](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34886561/)—a critical barrier that acts as the “first line” of defense, as it separates the “external” environment–containing commensal or pathogenic microorganisms–from the “internal” environment, which contains the intestinal epithelial cells. A breach in this barrier can lead to unfavorable bacteria passing through, potentially leading to [systemic inflammation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11739-023-03374-w#:~:text=Violation%20of%20the%20integrity%20of,thus%20leading%20to%20systemic%20inflammation.).

More generally, gut microbiota-derived metabolites are major factors in the gut-systemic health interplay. In particular, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are molecules produced from fermentation of non-digestible carbohydrates (mostly plant fiber). SCFAs are fuel for colon cells and integral in maintaining an intact gut barrier. SCFAs not only are involved in maintaining gut health, a [reduction in SCFAs](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-022-00974-4) have been associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma due to their anti-inflammatory properties.

## Hirschsprung's Disease

### H3

To start, it’s important to note that DS-01® Daily Synbiotic is regulated by the FDA as a dietary supplement, and as such, is not intended to treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition. Additionally, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied in individuals living with Hirschsprung’s Disease **\[or Hirschsprung’s-associated enterocolitis\]** specifically; therefore, we are unable to comment on any difference in effect or utility within this population.

\[OPTIONAL ADD-ON: For context, **\[DS-01®/PDS-08®\]** is formulated to provide support for digestive and systemic health with core benefits across gastrointestinal function, gut barrier integrity, immune health, and dermatological health. **\[DS-01®/PDS-08®\]** is not considered or regulated as a therapeutic and is therefore not intended to treat or prevent any condition or disease state. \]

This in mind, I’d be happy to share the current research on Hirschsprung’s disease, the gut microbiome, and probiotics if it would be of use to you. \[insert research from below options\]

As with anyone that has a preexisting digestive concern, we would ultimately recommend consulting with **\[your physician/your child’s pediatrician\]** before adding\*\* \[DS-01®/PDS-08®\] \*\* **to \[your/their\]** routine, as they can provide guidance with **\[your/their\]** full medical history in mind.

### disease description

[Hirschsprung’s disease](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22903) occurs when certain nerves along the colon fail to develop in utero, leading to continuous colonic spasms that may cause narrowing or blockage of specific colon segments. As a result, the “upstream” area of the colon can become dilated and distended as stool has difficulty moving past the constriction. While constrictions most often occur in colon segments closer to the rectum, they can also occur at higher points within or along the colon. Typically, Hirschsprung’s disease is diagnosed and treated with surgical intervention during infancy to improve symptoms and quality of life.

Hirschsprung’s disease patients also face the risk of [Hirschsprung’s-associated enterocolitis (HAEC)](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD013714.pub2/epdf/full), a severe intestinal inflammation that can cause fever, stomach distension, vomiting, or bloody stools. Although the [origin of HAEC](https://journals.lww.com/cmj/fulltext/2016/06200/novel_insights_into_the_pathogenesis_of.18.aspx) is unclear and likely multifactorial, the gut microbiome, mucus barrier, and immune response have all been proposed as potential contributors.

### Microbiome connection \+ probiotics

[Many studies](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/9/11/2241) have found differences in the diversity and composition of the gut microbiomes of those with Hirschsprung’s disease in comparison to those without the condition, as well as in those with HAEC. Interestingly, a few studies in both mice and children have found increased levels of *Proteobacteria* (including *Escherichia*) and a decrease in *Lactobacilli* in those with Hirschsprung’s disease as opposed to healthy controls. Some [studies](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2024.1366181/full) of Hirschsprung’s disease patients with HAEC similarly found differences either within the same patients pre- and post-surgery, or in [those with HAEC](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/19490976.2020.1711685) compared to those [without](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95589-0).

That said, these [differences](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/9/11/2241) in gut microbiome diversity and composition tend to vary by subject (animals vs. children), where the microbiome samples come from (fecal vs. above the constriction vs. below the constriction), and the length of colon affected.

Only a handful of [studies](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00383-017-4188-y) have examined the impact of probiotics on Hirschsprung’s, and have primarily looked at the prevention of HAEC. Whereas [one clinical trial](https://www.jpedsurg.org/article/S0022-3468\(12\)00804-4/abstract) found probiotics had no benefit in reducing the occurrence of HAEC, others found that probiotics may have the potential to decrease HAEC occurrence and severity, along with [modulating inflammatory responses](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25370155/) and increasing the gut microbiota alpha diversity.

All said, more studies are needed to understand the complex ways the gut microbiome could play a role in Hirschsprung’s disease or HAEC **\[across all life stages\]**, and whether probiotics could be an effective option.

**\[If asking for an adult:** Of note, because Hirschsprung’s disease is typically diagnosed and treated with surgical invention during the first year of life, studies of the microbiome in adults with Hirschsprung disease are extremely limited.\]

## Seaweed Digesting Gut Bacteria / Do only Japanese people have the gut bacteria to digest seaweed? / Does DS-01® help you digest Seaweed?

### Is it true that only japanese people (or people of asian descent) can digest seaweed?

In short, although seaweed-digesting gut bacteria is more common in people of Asian descent (especially those of Japanese and Southeast Asian descent), it can and does occur in North American populations as well.

This in mind, I'd be happy to elaborate a bit further on this topic, as you may find the research interesting.

For context, compared with more commonly consumed fiber-rich foods (e.g., fruits, vegetables, grains, etc.), the fiber components (polysaccharides) in seaweeds have different chemical structures that require specific degradative [enzymes](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258\(20\)52970-0/fulltext) to break them down​. As with nearly all dietary fibers, humans lack these enzymes and therefore rely on colonic bacteria for the ability to digest them.

Interestingly, it's theorized that humans have acquired the ability to digest seaweed from the open ocean, which is filled with seaweed degrading enzymes (and the bacteria that produce them). This suggests that populations that have historically relied on ocean foods (seaweed, fish, shellfish) are more likely to have a larger variety of seaweed-degrading bacteria in their guts.

Specifically, research has shown that certain Bacteroides bacteria (found in the human gut) possesses genes for degrading various seaweed-derived polysaccharides (including [porphyran](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6126907/)​, [agarose](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5849685/)​, [alginate](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5966431/)​, and [laminarin](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7157763/)​). Further, some [Firmicutes](https://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/fulltext/S1931-3128\(22\)00087-7#)​​ (a bacteria that thrives in the human gut) were also recently discovered to be able to digest certain seaweed polysaccharides as well.

And although it's true that these bacteria are more [common](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20376150/)​ (and more diverse) in those of Japanese and Southeast Asian descent (given these cultures have historically relied on the ocean as a main food source), some seaweed-degrading bacteria has been found in samples from [North America](https://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/fulltext/S1931-3128\(22\)00087-7)​ as well, especially those with the ability to degrade carrageenan, a seaweed-polysaccharide commonly used in foods as a stabilizer.

Lastly, it's important to mention that the research in this area is not exhaustive or fully representative, as the studies done have only sampled from relatively small portions of various populations, and have not sampled from all global ethnicities.

\[OPTIONAL ADD-ON: This in mind, it may be most valuable to rely on your own individual experience of eating seaweed (e.g., whether it causes digestive upset or not), and let that be your personal guide. We would also suggest a conversation with a clinician to evaluate the reason and action plan for any digestive concerns. \]

### Does DS-01® help to digest seaweed?

In terms of DS-01® Daily Synbiotic specifically, kindly note that our product has not been studied for its capacity to aid in the digestion of foods like seaweed, and its formulation does not include bacterial strains from the Bacteroides and Firmicutes genera, which are noted as supporting the digestion or breakdown of seaweed.

For further context, DS-01® includes solely probiotic strains from the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera with a long history of research, extensive safety records, and long-term microbiome stability data in a heterogenous population. The research on seaweed-degrading bacteria is still relatively new, and as far as we are aware, there aren't currently any supplements that contain probiotic organisms geared towards digestion of seaweeds specifically.

## Thyroid medication

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

To start, there are no known or studied contraindications between **\[DS-01®️ / PDS-08®️ Pediatric\]** Daily Synbiotic and prescription or over-the-counter medications; therefore, it would generally be safe to take alongside a thyroid medication, such as **\[medication name\]**.

This in mind, it is important to note that we haven’t conducted studies evaluating the effects of **\[DS-01®️ / PDS-08®️\]** on thyroid medication absorption, or its interaction with various endogenous thyroid hormones, specifically. Given that absorption of thyroid medication is [known](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/spl/data/d617a5e7-44cb-6457-e053-2995a90ae75c/d617a5e7-44cb-6457-e053-2995a90ae75c.xml#section_7.9) to be influenced by various medications, supplements, and food/nutrients, it may be prudent to separate probiotic intake from thyroid medication intake by at least [two hours](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10166268/) to ensure optimal absorption of your thyroid medication. If you prefer, you can also separate intake further, such as taking one in the morning, and one at night. \[insert language about [taking **DS-01®️ with/without food**](https://app.getguru.com/card/i7j7p7rT/Why-is-it-recommended-to-take-DS01-on-an-empty-stomach-Can-I-take-DS01-with-foodon-a-full-stomach)\*\* if needed\]\*\*.

**DM:** Hi there––SciCare here, following up on your comment on our post regarding combining medications and DS-01®. As there are no known contraindications between probiotics and medications, it would generally be fine to take DS-01® alongside \[medications such as (insert name) / thyroid medications\]. This in mind, kindly note, we haven’t specifically evaluated how DS-01® impacts thyroid hormones or the absorption of thyroid medications. Given that thyroid medication absorption may be affected influenced by various medications, supplements, and food/nutrients \[1\], it may be wise to separate your probiotic and thyroid medication intake by at least two hours \[2\].

For example, the microbiota influences the uptake of minerals and nutrients which are of interest to thyroid health—such as iodine, selenium, and iron.

In fact, several [findings](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7353203/) support the hypothesis that the gut microbiota could play a role in thyroid function within the host—for instance, the altered microbiota composition in people living with thyroid disorders; germ-free rats presenting with smaller thyroids than normal [rats](https://www.cell.com/trends/endocrinology-metabolism/fulltext/S1043-2760\(19\)30107-9?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1043276019301079%3Fshowall%3Dtrue); and the prominent metabolism of thyroid hormones by gut microbiota. Intestinal dysbiosis or bacterial overgrowth, intestinal hyper-permeability, and a shift to a pro-inflammatory state are a few factors that may lead to health implications within the thyroid and its function.

That all said, most of the research on microbiota and thyroid interaction is associative, and how / if this research could translate to probiotic use is not yet known.

In addition, there are several factors which can influence thyroid hormone production—some of which include seasonal/circadian rhythm changes, time of lab blood draw, diet, and immune function changes/status. Importantly, there is a need for more rigorous clinical studies to determine the specific strains and dosage that would elicit any particular effects on thyroid function.

Of note, a recent [meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10783727/) (a systematic review of previous randomized controlled trials), found that taking probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics did not significantly alter thyroid hormone levels (TSH, fT3, or fT4) in individuals with thyroid disease (e.g., hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroid cancer), or those at risk of hypothyroidism. The review did find a modest reduction in thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibody (TRAb) levels specific to patients with Graves’ disease (an autoimmune disorder causing hyperthyroidism), though the authors noted that this may not actually be considered significant.

To provide further detail, this meta-analysis included a total of 8 randomized controlled trials involving 367 participants aged 18-65 years, and interventions ranged from 4 weeks to 12 months. The probiotic strains tested were from the genus *Lactobacillus*, *Streptococcus*, *Bifidobacterium*, and *Enterococcus*, and the prebiotics included phytochemicals as well as fibers.

Three of the studies included in this review were conducted in hypothyroid patients taking a thyroid medication (levothyroxine). Out of these three studies, two of them (linked [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9901790/) and [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5694461/)) found no change in thyroid hormone levels (TSH, fT4, fT3) in either probiotic or control group, while one [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31987229/) did find slightly decreased TSH levels and a lower required levothyroxine dose in the probiotic group. However, the authors noted that this latter study had a high risk of bias due to flaws in trial design, and thus their results should be interpreted cautiously, especially given the other studies did not find the same effect.

To conclude, these findings suggest that probiotics would generally not be expected to significantly impact thyroid hormone levels in people who have a thyroid condition, and/or for people taking a thyroid medication.

All said, we understand that every body has its own unique physiology, health history and microbial mosaic. With this in mind, we recommend monitoring your health closely and consulting with a health care practitioner who may help provide specific guidance tailored to your personal health condition.

## Group B Streptococcus (GBS)

### VERSION 1 (SIMPLE)

Kindly note that VS-01™ Vaginal Synbiotic is not intended to treat, prevent, or cure any condition or disease state. Further, VS-01™ has not been clinically evaluated in **\[pregnant\]** individuals with group B *Streptococcus* (GBS) infections, so we are unable to comment on any difference in effect, safety, or utility in these populations.

Thus, as with any new health protocol you consider **\[during pregnancy/with an existing vaginal concern\],** we always recommend speaking with a physician or **\[obstetrician/gynecologist\]** before incorporating a new product (including VS-01™) into your routine.

**\[OPTIONAL if concerned about safety during pregnancy: refer to** [Is VS-01™ safe to take while pregnant and/or breastfeeding?](https://app.getguru.com/card/T8yb4bnc/Is-VS01-safe-to-take-while-pregnant-andor-breastfeeding?) **\]**

**\[OPTIONAL for more research:**

That said, I’d be happy to share the current research perspective on GBS, the vaginal microbiome, and probiotics.

Although GBS—also known ass \_Streptococcus agalactiae—\_is a leading cause of neonatal infections and adverse pregnancy outcomes, one [systematic review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8136278/) found less than 30% of relevant studies measured GBS presence. In addition, a significant portion of the current research in this area has been done in cells in the lab (in vitro) or in animal models, rather than in humans.

Interestingly, one study in humans found the presence of certain [lactobacilli](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36145412/) to be inversely correlated with GBS colonization in the third trimester of pregnancy.

Specific *Lactobacillus* strains have also been tested in various models and clinical trials to determine their efficacy against GBS colonization. For example, a [combined oral probiotic](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33380389/) of *L. rhamnosus* and\_ L. reuteri\_ significantly reduced GBS abundance, and one study showed 72% of GBS-positive pregnant women who received a probiotic of\_ [*L. salivarius*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6521265/) \_during the latter half of pregnancy were found to be GBS-negative at 38 weeks. All told, more studies are needed to determine the relationship between GBS [colonization patterns](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24979575/), the vaginal microbiome, and [pregnancy outcomes](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X\(22\)00093-6/), as well as how vaginal probiotics may affect these. **\]**

### VERSION 2 (TECHNICAL)

Kindly note that VS-01™ Vaginal Synbiotic is not intended to treat, prevent, or cure any condition or disease state. Further, VS-01™ has not been clinically evaluated in **\[pregnant\]** individuals with group B *Streptococcus* (GBS) infections, so we are unable to comment on any difference in effect, safety, or utility in these populations.

Thus, as with any new health protocol you consider **\[during pregnancy/with an existing vaginal concern\],** we always recommend speaking with a physician or **\[obstetrician/gynecologist\]** before incorporating a new product (including VS-01™) into your routine.

This all in mind, I would be happy to share the current research on GBS , in case this is of interest.

**\[INCLUDE RESEARCH SECTIONS BELOW AS NEEDED\]**

With this all said, as the benefits of probiotics can vary by strain, dosage, delivery method, and target population; as such, many more rigorous human clinical trials are needed to determine if probiotics could be used to treat or prevent GBS.

**\[ALT ending/ add-on:** All said, when cross-comparing the literature, it’s important to take note of differences in trial design, probiotic strains used and other ingredients, dosage, and delivery mechanism, as each may contribute to outcome variance across a similar population. \]

### RESEARCH SECTIONS

#### GBS background \+ Pregnancy—ONLY if specifically asked by member

[Group B Streptococcus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482443/) (GBS, or *Streptococcus agalactiae*) is often asymptomatic and can even live [harmlessly](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12866-022-02730-8#ref-CR28) in the vagina—however, in infants, pregnant or postpartum women, or elderly adults, it can cause persistent infections and [complications](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482443/).

GBS can [colonize](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38436256/) the vagina and rectum, and up to almost 30% of pregnant women have short- or long-term infections (though this [varies by region](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/65/suppl_2/S100/4589589?login=false)). As GBS can be transferred through vaginal contact, it has emerged as a leading cause of adverse [pregnancy outcomes](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X\(22\)00093-6/)—including stillbirths, preterm births, pneumonia, and meningitis, along with maternal sepsis and postpartum endometritis.

However, despite being a leading cause of neonatal infections and adverse pregnancy outcomes, one [systematic review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8136278/) found less than 30% of relevant studies measured GBS presence. In addition, most research has been done *in vitro* (in cells in the lab)—so many more human clinical trials are needed to determine the relationship between GBS [colonization patterns](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24979575/), the vaginal microbiome, and pregnancy outcomes.

#### GBS, Lactobacilli, Probiotics

**NOTE: Must use both Lacto \+ Non-Lacto paragraphs together to provide 'counter' research options\!**

Specific *Lactobacillus* strains have been tested in various models and clinical trials for their potential efficacy against GBS colonization.\*\* \*\*Interestingly, one study found the presence of [*Lactobacillus crispatus*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36145412/) was inversely correlated with GBS colonization in the third trimester of pregnancy. Additionally, [*L. reuteri*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25786121/) was found to reduce the number of viable GBS cells in an *in vitro* mouse model, and in a human clinical trial, 68% of GBS-positive pregnant women who received a probiotic of [*L. salivarius*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6521265/) \_during the latter half of pregnancy were found to be GBS-negative at 38 weeks. Similarly, a [combined oral probiotic](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33380389/) of *L. rhamnosus* and *L. reuteri* significantly reduced GBS abundance, modulated vaginal microbiome composition, and reduced presence of bacteria associated with vaginal disease (*Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus).* It is hypothesized that reduction of GBS abundance by lactobacilli could be related to the [aggregation of GBS cells](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31445119/) or [inhibition of attachment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16869901/) to the vaginal epithelium.

Non-*Lactobacillus* species have also been examined for their potential to limit GBS colonization. For example, in a mouse model, [*Streptococcus salivarius* K12](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26077762/) reduced GBS colonization; of note, this inhibition depended on the K12 megaplasmid that encodes for bacteriocins (i.e., bacteria-killing compounds). [*Akkermansia muciniphila* combined with zinc deficiency](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9429885/) led to an increased susceptibility for GBS presence, thus suggesting the potential to impact GBS colonization by modulating *A. muciniphila* and zinc availability.

**\[OPTIONAL if asking about neonatal outcomes for probiotics specifically\]** As [research](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9657808/) on probiotic use for GBS colonization during pregnancy continues to emerge, very few studies have measured neonatal outcomes. Although studies of probiotic use in pregnant individuals with GBS have not reported adverse effects for mother or baby, more trials are necessary to assess the safety, efficacy, and neonatal outcomes of using probiotics in these populations.

**\[OPTIONAL Oral vs. Intravaginal Application\]** Currently, most studies examine the impacts of oral––rather than vaginal––administration of probiotics on GBS colonization.

*(\[refer to [How is VS-01™ different than \[X vaginal supplement or suppository\]](https://app.getguru.com/card/TG9Rx8zc/How-is-VS01-different-than-X-vaginal-supplement-or-suppository)? for verbiage on oral vs. intravaginal)*

Therefore, it is currently not known if oral or intravaginal probiotics are more effective, and further studies are needed to understand if the route of administration leads to differences in outcomes.

#### GBS Treatment, Antibiotics, Vaccine—ONLY if asked specifically by member

Currently, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP)—i.e., antibiotics administered during delivery—is the predominant therapy for reducing early-onset GBS in infants. While IAP effectively reduces GBS infection, new research is emerging regarding the impact of IAP on infant health.

One such study found IAP [may increase the risk of food allergy](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36533241/) in children under 18 months old, while others observed associations between IAP and [higher incidence of atopic dermatitis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36460975/) (AD) and a [modest increase in early childhood weight gain](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33958387/). However, these results are not universal: other studies have suggested IAP is [not associated with asthma, eczema, food allergy, or allergic rhinitis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33833072/), and that any impacts of IAP on infant microbial ecology [disappear by 12 weeks of age](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29184093/).

**\[OPTIONAL: GBS Vaccine\]** In 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) identified the [GBS vaccine](https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/347597/9789240022515-eng.pdf?sequence=1) as a priority due to the high burden of disease, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Since then, GBS vaccine candidates have been in development, and [3 possible vaccines](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X23004164) are in Phase II of clinical trials. One [vaccine candidate](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37467497/) recently completed their Phase II clinical trial, and found their vaccine led to anti-GBS antibodies developing in pregnant women, and then passed to the infants to reduce risk of GBS disease. However, while promising, GBS vaccine development is still in the early stages, and requires further clinical trials before implementation.

## Calcium

### Relationship between calcium and DS-01®

[External research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34502371/)​ has shown that the gut microbiome plays a role in the absorption of calcium, thereby impacting [bone structure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5710820/)​; however, the exact mechanisms, impacts, and applications appear to vary by strain, so more clinical research is needed.

Kindly note that calcium absorption was neither targeted while formulating DS-01®, nor clinically evaluated as an endpoint, so we cannot comment on any difference in efficacy or utility in this regard.

## Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) \- CD, UC, MC

**\[Background on IBD:** [Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10012812/)) are multifaceted, immune disorders of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are the two major clinical phenotypes of IBD. Both UC and CD involve inflammation in the GI tract with [symptoms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6685307/) that can include diarrhea, rectal pain, abdominal pain.

UC generally is localized in the colon, whereas CD can affect any part of the GI tract (from mouth to the anus). Further, UC is a continuous, confluent inflammation of the colon, while there can be healthy portions mixed with inflamed sections of the GI tract in CD. \]

**NOTE: Pouchitis is a complication from IBD surgery (ileoanal anastomosis, J-pouch surgery) — more info found in this card:** [Pouchitis](https://app.getguru.com/card/cnqE7Lei/Pouchitis) \]

### GENERAL ibd (did not mention type)

As the field stands, it is [inconclusive](https://www.eurekaselect.com/article/105166)​ whether probiotics can be an effective therapeutic or intervention strategy for IBD. While there are studies examining probiotics in the context of IBD (or specifically in the clinical subtypes, ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease), majority of studies have been conducted \*in vitro—\*either in cells or in animal models. This urges the need for clinical trials in humans to better understand the efficacy of probiotics in managing IBD.

Although under the umbrella of IBD, ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) do not present the same—and thus, respond differently to the same treatment. One [meta-analysis](https://academic.oup.com/ibdjournal/article/20/1/21/4578819?)​ examining clinical trials using probiotics for UC, pouchitis, and CD patients indicated that while probiotics were beneficial for maintaining remission in UC and pouchitis patients, the same benefit was not seen in CD patients.

Therefore, while probiotics are generally safe as an [adjunct therapy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9952932/)​ in the management of IBD, there is still a need for large samples of high-quality clinical trials to further determine the efficacy and strain-specific utility of probiotic agents in the induction and maintenance of IBD, especially CD.

### Crohn's Disease

Due to the potential involvement of the gut microbiota in [pathogenesis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9369148/)​ of Crohn's disease (CD), probiotic use is one strategy that may help with treatment of CD. While there is some [research](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10998680/)​ showing the beneficial role of probiotics in IBD (primarily ulcerative colitis), there is less regarding CD, specifically.

One [meta-analysis](https://academic.oup.com/ibdjournal/article/20/1/21/4578819?)​ examining clinical trials using probiotics for ulcerative colitis (UC), pouchitis, and CD patients indicated that while probiotics were beneficial for maintaining remission in UC and pouchitis patients, the same benefit was not seen in CD patients.

Similarly, another [analysis](https://apm.amegroups.org/article/view/83657/html)​ found probiotics could potentially induce remission for UC, but did not present the same for CD. As the field currently stands, it seems there is [no strong evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9244564/)​ that supports the use of probiotics to induce remission in CD. The [research](https://www.eurekaselect.com/article/105166)​ calls for better clinical trials with larger sample sizes to identify the strains, dosages, and duration of probiotics needed for CD treatment.

Therefore, while probiotics are generally safe to as an [adjunct therapy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9952932/)​ in the management of IBD, there is still a need for large samples of high-quality clinical trials to further determine the efficacy and strain-specific utility of probiotic agents in the induction and maintenance of IBD, especially CD.

### ULCERATIVE COLITIS

While the development of ulcerative colitis remains complex and multifactorial, the commensal microbiome has been [implicated](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32040250/) in the pathogenesis / development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC).

[Scientific literature](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29135456/) indicates promising results for the use of probiotics in patients with IBD, such as decreased pain, diarrhea, bloating, gas, and mucus production. The general [mechanisms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319562X22001206) include improved gut barrier integrity, balanced immune responses, and favorable changes in the levels of a number of metabolites that are associated with lowered levels of mucosal inflammation. A recent [review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213434420300190?casa_token=LZbgfrec_QcAAAAA%3AxVFqdBStPrFh6Yk77K_RE8mteiTnWOZZMybkQ_UTydnvnYzgEvBWbV5WUgCKx5F0O7eM51MyA9U#bib0010) of 36 studies found that probiotics alone or in combination with conventional therapies may improve remission rates in UC patients, along with disease severity and clinical outcomes—including rectal bleeding and stool consistency. Another [systematic review](https://www.cochrane.org/CD005573/probiotics-treatment-active-ulcerative-colitis) found that probiotics may improve induction of clinical remission in UC patients compared to placebo, but limited evidence to suggest that probiotics are superior to 5-ASA (a treatment standard).

### microscopic colitis

**\[Background on MC:** [Microscopic colitis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10342440/) is another subtype of IBD, characterized by chronic watery diarrhea and diagnosed through histology of the colon. Microscopic colitis has two subtypes, collagenous colitis or lymphocytic colitis, depending on the characteristics of the histological sample. \]

The development of microscopic colitis is not well understood, though [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5879520/) suggests inflammation, gut barrier, immunity, and the microbiome may all play a role.

At this time, the research surrounding probiotic supplementation for microscopic colitis is [uncertain](https://academic.oup.com/ibdjournal/article/12/5/395/4682675) and still in its infancy—further clinical studies are needed to explore the potential role probiotics could play in the treatment and prevention of microscopic colitis, before any conclusions can be made.

**\[Optional Add-on**: While current evidence is [limited](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3959332/)​, probiotics have been [speculated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5879520/)​ as modulators of the gut microbiota and intestinal barrier, which may benefit lymphocytic colitis (LC) patients. \]

## Oral Microbiome

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

The oral microbiome harbors its own unique ecosystem of around [**700**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1287824/) different microbial species. (Interestingly, [**research**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6427756/) shows that there is also a connection between the gut microbiome and oral microbiome, although a clear understanding of how, and in what ways, is still actively being researched.)

The oral microbiome has been implicated in its connection to illness and disease, playing a direct role in the development of dental caries (cavities) and periodontal disease. Recent [**findings**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1756464620302097) suggest that probiotics may have the potential to help.

For context, one way periodontal conditions occur begins with the congregation of plaque bacteria in the mouth. Probiotics can help in a few [**ways**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3760351/#:~:text=Probiotics%20decrease%20the%20pH%20of,product%20because%20they%20produce%20antioxidants.): lowering oral pH (and therefore, preventing conditions which plaque bacteria thrive), producing antioxidants (which neutralize elements needed for plaque/mineral formation), and breaking down toxic gases into elements necessary for metabolism—thereby also working against malodor.

Notably, while further study is still needed in this field, species and strains from the *lactobacillus* and *bifidobacterium* genera have been [**researched**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2897872/) most thoroughly on the topic to date.

---

## Diindolylmethane (DIM)

### Version 1

First, for reassurance, while the relationship between probiotics and many supplements are still being explored, there are no known contraindications between probiotics and medications; therefore, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic would be generally safe to take alongside any prescription or over-the-counter medication(s)—including natural sources of phytonutrients such as DIM. (Of interest, DIM is also found in many cruciferous vegetables and has shown potential for promoting [skin health](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35107361/)​ and [intestinal barrier integrity](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b03039)​.) Notably, many probiotic microbial strains can actually help metabolize and increase [bioavailability](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9424995/)​ and absorption of certain phytonutrients.

---

## Atopic Dermatitis (Eczema)

### Version 2 (deeper explanation)

While **\[DS-01®/PDS-08®\]** does include strains which have been [**studied**](https://seed.com/reference/pds-wk) to support skin health and reinforce the gut-skin axis, our product has not been specifically studied in populations with eczema, so we therefore cannot comment on any specific effects in this regard.

Moreover, it is important to note that **\[DS-01®/PDS-08®\]** is regulated by the FDA as a dietary supplement, and as such, is not intended to diagnose, treat, prevent, or cure any condition or disease state. Ultimately, it is best to work with **\[your/your child's\]** healthcare provider to ensure the appropriateness of a dietary supplement (including ours\!) for\*\* \[your/your child’s\]\*\* particular needs, due to their unique medical history and the specific benefits you’re interested in. If you’re interested, you can find a full list of our strains and ingredients [**here**](https://seed.com/reference/pds-wk) for reference in this discussion.

That said, I’d be happy to share some relevant research on eczema and probiotics in general, if that is of use.

As you may know, the gut microbiome is believed to play a role in a wide variety of skin conditions by way of the gut-skin axis—the bidirectional relationship between your gut microbes and your skin.

Current research suggests the [disruption](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8073639/)​ of the gut microbiome may play a role in eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis (AD). In general, individuals with AD tend to have [lower diversity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8317022/) ​of gut microbiota—in particular, less *Lactobacilli* and *Bifidobacteria*—potentially reducing the amount of beneficial bacterial metabolites like [short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9932284/)​.

**\[If asking about childhood AD:** In fact, in adolescents, administration of a [probiotic mix](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8826069/)​​ of three *Lactobacillus* strains and one *Bifidobacterium* strain led to decreases in the [SCORAD index](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24035157/)​ (one of the best clinical tools used to measure AD severity). That said, a [meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32748341/)​ noted that the efficacy of probiotics on childhood AD is affected by the participant's age, the strain/dose used, and when the probiotics were administered; thus, further studies and more rigorous clinical trials are needed before a specific probiotic can be recommended for AD treatment.\]

**\[If asking about adult AD specifically:** A [meta-analysis](https://jhpn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41043-022-00318-6)​ of six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults found that oral probiotics could significantly decrease eczema severity as measured by [SCORAD index](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24035157/)​ (one of the best clinical tools used to measure AD severity)—but did not do the same for itch severity, skin severity, quality of life, or immune response (although, these effects varied by study and strain).

Interestingly, [a recent systematic review](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09546634.2022.2080170#d1e313) ​and meta-analysis of nine RCTs also found oral probiotics could significantly reduce short-term and long-term symptom severity in adult eczema patients (as measured by SCORAD). Further, the study found that probiotics significantly increased quality of life measures in the long term, but in the not short term. Based on network analyses, researchers also found probiotics containing Lactobacillus salivarius and Bifidobacterium to be most highly associated with positive outcomes.

With all of this in mind, more randomized controlled trials are still needed to determine the efficacy of using probiotics to treat AD in adults, as well as the optimal strains and dosages.\]

## Biotin / Vitamin B7

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

\[If asking if DS-01® contains biotin/B7: To start, I can confirm DS-01® is not formulated with biotin (also known as vitamin B7); you can find our complete strain list and included ingredients [here](https://seed.com/reference/syn-wk#label-101)​. \]

\[If asking if DS-01® impacts biotin/B7: In addition, kindly note that DS-01® was neither formulated nor tested for its impact on vitamin B7 levels, so we cannot comment on any difference in effect or utility in this regard.\]

\[If asking if can take biotin supplement with DS-01®: That said, as there are no known contraindications between probiotics and other dietary supplements, DS-01® should be fine to combine with a biotin supplement if you choose.\]

\[Optional research add-in: This in mind, I’d be happy to share with you the current research on the gut microbiome and biotin, if it would be of use to you.

Interestingly, [research](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2022.1031502/full)​ indicates some bacterial species in the gut microbiome play a key role in biotin (vitamin B7) production and absorption (interestingly, humans cannot make this vitamin themselves). Conversely, vitamin B7 can also influence the gut microbiome, though this varies by bacterial species.

Regarding probiotics specifically, most clinical trials (such as [this one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7695208/)​) have evaluated the efficacy of probiotics when taken with B7, rather than the effects of probiotics on levels of B7. More clinical trials are therefore needed to understand any potential impact of probiotics on biotin levels.\]

Ultimately, we always recommend consulting with your primary care physician when considering \[adding a supplement such as DS-01® / combining supplements such as DS-01® and biotin\], as they can provide personalized advice with your unique medical history and health goals in mind.

## Vulvar Lichen Sclerosis

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

*Note: VLS may be an autoimmune condition, though it is not typically treated with immunosuppressants.*

To start, kindly note that we have not clinically evaluated VS-01™ with respect to its impact on any diseases or conditions, including in populations living with Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus (VLS) **\[or autoimmune conditions\]**; therefore, we cannot make any claims related to VLS and are unable to comment on any difference in effect, utility or safety in these populations.

Rather, VS-01™ is formulated to restore an optimal vaginal microbiome and protect against pH disruptors via Lactobacillus crispatus probiotic strains.

We would therefore suggest consulting with your physician, as they know your complete health history and can best advise on whether VS-01™ would be right for your unique ecosystem.

This in mind, I would be happy to share some with you the current research perspective on VLS and the microbiome.

A handful of small studies have examined the differences in the microbiomes of those with and without VLS. Although these studies all found differences in the diversity and composition of microbiomes of those with and without VLS, these differences were not consistent across studies. This variation is likely a result of each study differing in its design and which microbiomes it sampled (e.g. [vulvar](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1264768/full)​, vaginal, gut, skin, or [urinary](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301211523003093)​), as well as the age group (e.g. [prepubertal](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0245243)​, [peri/postmenopausal](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-58983-y)​, or [unspecified](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cell-and-developmental-biology/articles/10.3389/fcell.2022.842031/full)​). In addition, these studies did not identify whether a difference in microbiome contributed to VLS, or whether VLS contributed to a difference in microbiome.

Because scientists are just beginning to understand the microbiome differences that might be associated with VLS, the effects and safety of probiotics for those with VLS is understudied. Current [clinical recommendations](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9978401/)​ for treating VLS do not include probiotics, and to date, no clinical studies have been published regarding the effects of probiotics on VLS. Much more clinical research is therefore needed to determine how probiotics may impact individuals with VLS.

## Hyperoxaluria / Oxalate Metabolism / Oxalate Content

### Version 2 (deeper explanation)

**\[OPTIONAL ADD ON for contextual information about the condition of Hyperoxaluria:**

For context, hyperoxaluria is a condition that can occur with a high urine oxalate concentration. Although oxalate is a natural chemical made by the body, and is found in some foods, too much oxalate can cause issues, such as kidney stones. While primary hyperoxaluria is inherited, secondary hyperoxaluria can be caused by other factors, such as a high oxalate diet, or intestinal problems that cause the body to absorb more oxalate from foods.

Ultimately, the goal of treatment for hyperoxaluria is generally to lower oxalate levels in the body and prevent calcium oxalate crystals from forming. This is often done through prescription medications, dietary supplements, dietary changes, and in some cases, procedures. \]

First, it's important to note that we have not studied **\[DS-01® / PDS-08®\]** Daily Synbiotic for any effects on oxalate metabolism specifically, nor in people with **\[primary/secondary Hyperoxaluria\]**. With this in mind, we're ultimately unable to comment on any differences in effect, safety, or utility in this regard.

That said, in case it's helpful, I'd be happy to provide some information based on a current review of the literature, in regard to probiotics and oxalate metabolism in general.

In scientific literature, [lactic acid bacteria](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9498451/)​ (including *Bifidobacterium* and\_ Lactobacillus\_) have been found to have some oxalate degradation properties—however, the species and strain are important as these oxalate-degrading mechanisms are specific to each strain. Of note, *Oxalobacter formigenes,* the ""best"" studied oxalate-degrading gut bacteria, uses oxalate as its primary energy source; although results in [animals studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3064122/)​ have been encouraging, [human clinical trials](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8388816/)​​ with this probiotic species have not been successful at reducing oxalate (in urinary excretion).

Interestingly, one [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34783577/)​ in mice found short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were associated with decreased levels of urinary oxalates. However, it is important to note this study was conducted in mice and may not be translatable to humans. Therefore, further studies are needed to understand the supplementation of probiotics or other bacterial metabolites on oxalate reduction.

Overall, further studies are needed to better understand the supplementation of probiotics or other bacterial metabolites and how that may impact oxalate reduction or metabolism. We would ultimately recommend consulting with a healthcare provider in regards to appropriate supplements, as they are best suited to advise with your complete health history in mind.

**\[OPTIONAL ADD ON if asking about more information on** ***Oxalobacter formigenes***\*\* probiotic strain\]\*\*

In reviewing this [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8773937/)​, it appears that it may be difficult to make probiotics containing *O. formigenes*, potentially ""due to its sensitivity to oxygen and low pH, strict oxalate demand for growth, and intolerance to the processes which are commonly involved in the manufacture, storage, and distribution of probiotic products."" Given this, and additional studies this paper references, it appears that more research is needed to determine the production conditions necessary for the commercial development of consistent and reliable *O. formigenes* probiotic supplements.

**\[OPTIONAL ADD ON if asking about Oxalate content in DS-01®—particularly as it relates to pomegranate punicalagins)**

To start, it’s important to note that we have not directly measured oxalate amounts in DS-01® Daily Synbiotic.

That said, I’d be happy to provide you with additional information about DS-01®'s prebiotic ingredient, pomegranate punicalagins, as well as general research on pomegranates and kidney stones.

For context, the patented prebiotic formula in DS-01® (also called Microbiota-Accessible Polyphenolic Precursors™, MAPP) is a class of bioactive plant compounds (punicalagins) that are derived from the fruit and skin of Indian pomegranate. This prebiotic is a novel class of non-fermenting prebiotics, and the punicalagins exert their prebiotic effect when acted upon by specific microorganisms in the gut—producing smaller, beneficial metabolites for the body, such as ellagic acid and various [urolithins](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2022.917266/full). Given the punicalagins are a novel, patented product, you won't find it in many other products, as most commercial probiotics use fermentable prebiotics, such as Fructooligosaccharide (FOS), Galactooligosaccharide (GOS), and inulin.

### UROLITHIN-A OPTIONAL ADD-ON

**\[Optional add-on:** You may be interested to know that in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial, DS-01® significantly increased Urolithin A—**\[a powerful molecule for healthy aging / which promotes cellular health/longevity/healthy aging\]**—in healthy adults, and recovery of Urolithin A in individuals experiencing occasional gut stress.

**Technical audience**: DS-01® is clinically validated to increase Urolithin A production in urine 1000-fold in individuals experiencing occasional gut stress (*p*\=0.008).\*\* \]\*\*

In terms of oxalate content, each daily dose of DS-01® (2 capsules) delivers 400mg of polyphenolic bioactives. For context, according to the [Oxalosis and Hyperoxaluria Foundation](https://ohf.org/fruit-oxalate/)​, the average oxalate content per 100g of pomegranate seed and juice sacs is 78mg. This translates to .078mg oxalate per 1mg of pomegranate seeds/juice. Given that our punicalagin content is 400mg per 2 capsules, this means that the potential oxalate content would be approximately .312mg total oxalate (400 x .078) per serving. Although we don't have exact measurements, this approximate total is likely an overestimate, given our product is an extract of the plant bioactive compounds, and not the pure fruit.

For further context, a recent [meta analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5877626/#B24-ijms-19-00765) reviewed several plant-based compounds for their potential role in the prevention and management of kidney stones, and the researchers found that certain pomegranate extracts demonstrated significant anti-urolithiasis effects (urolithiasis is the formation of urinary calculi or “stones”), and influenced multiple markers of kidney health—indicating that this intervention could successfully help to control the risk of renal stone formation. In addition, this [pilot study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25085198/) demonstrated supplementation with pomegranate extract did not increase the risk of stones in those prone to developing them.

Ultimately, we do always recommend consulting with your healthcare provider whenever considering adding a new dietary supplement to your routine, especially if there are pre-existing medical conditions or health concerns, as they can best advise with your full health history in mind.\*\* \]\*\*

**\[OPTIONAL ADD ON if asking about Oxalate content in Leafy Greens**

It is true that, many leafy greens are a concentrated source of oxalates (in addition to vitamins and minerals). This being said, not all leafy greens are equal in their oxalate content, and for individuals that would like to incorporate more of these vegetables in their diet, some lower-oxalate [sources](https://ohf.org/vegetables-oxalate/) include kale, bibb lettuce, romaine, bok choy, aruga, collard, and mustard greens. Importantly, while oxalates may inhibit the absorption of some vitamins in minerals, they are also a normal end product of mammalian metabolism, and according to current research, the incorporation of higher oxalate foods as part of an [overall nutritious diet](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24393738/) should not pose any particular problems for the average healthy human.\*\* \]\*\*

## Probiotics \+ Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)

### NOTE:

Compliance Reminder: if you mention a specific strain that happens to be in DS-01® while discussing a disease state, you must also include research on a strain not included in our formulation, to provide a well-rounded/unbiased view on probiotics \+ medical conditions (without specifying which strain(s) mentioned are in our product).

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

Kindly note, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied in individuals with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) nor has the alleviation of acid reflux (heartburn) or esophageal discomfort been evaluated as an endpoint in formulating our product.

Rather, DS-01® provides support for overall healthy gut function. **\[OPTIONAL:** include relevant [DS-01® Benefits • Digestive Health](https://app.getguru.com/card/iajMBeET/DS01-Benefits-Digestive-Health)**\]**

Interestingly, [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7019778/)​ suggest that probiotics may be beneficial for GERD/acid reflux—participants in studies noted a decrease in dyspepsia (indigestion) or reduced reflux episodes. However, as noted in the article, more rigorous and larger studies are needed to properly determine and assess probiotic use in individuals with GERD or acid reflux.

**\[OPTIONAL if asking about gastric probiotic:** As the gastric environment is harsh, it is difficult to examine the effects of probiotics in this environment—for context, they would likely need to release in the stomach and survive the conditions to exert effects. This is an understudied aspect of gastric research—more studies and clinical trials are warranted to confirm the true efficacy of probiotics in alleviating these symptoms.**\]**

**\[OPTIONAL if asking our product releases in stomach:** Due to the vulnerability of probiotic bacteria to the acidic conditions of the stomach and the bile salts in our intestines (with survival rates being [20-40%](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11157348/)), our product is not intended to release the probiotics in the stomach. Precise delivery of probiotics is crucial to ensure they survive GI stresses and are delivered live to specific locations, along the small intestine and the colon, imparting health benefits associated with their [mechanisms of action](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2022.1000517/full#:~:text=Probiotics%20exert%20beneficial%20effects%20on,modulate%20the%20host%20\(75\).). **\]**

## Thyroid health / Hashimoto's / Grave's Disease / Hyperthyroidism

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

Kindly note, DS-01® is regulated by the FDA as a supplement and as such is not intended to treat, diagnose, prevent, or cure any disease or condition. Additionally, DS-01® has not been studied in individuals with thyroid concerns or \[Hashimoto's Thyroiditis / Grave's Disease / hyperthyroidism\] specifically. We therefore cannot comment on any difference in safety, utility, or effect in these populations.

**\[Insert recommendations regarding [thyroid medication](https://app.getguru.com/card/ikGrzkeT/Thyroid-medication) or [immunosuppressants](https://app.getguru.com/card/iaELzzLT/Immunosuppressants-Immunocompromised) (sometimes used in treating Hashimoto's) if needed\]**

With all of this in mind, we ultimately suggest consulting with your primary care physician before adding DS-01® to your routine, as they can provide personalized medical guidance based on your unique health history and current medication regime.

To provide you with additional background information to guide this conversation with your doctor, however, I would also be happy to summarize the current research for you surrounding the gut microbiome and **\[thyroid health / Grave's disease / Hashimoto's Thyroiditis\]... \[insert from below\]**

### General Thyroid Health

Thyroid function and the gut microbiome are certainly connected, a relationship known as the gut-thyroid axis. For example, the microbiota influences the uptake of minerals and nutrients which are of interest to thyroid health—such as iodine, selenium, and iron.

In fact, several [findings](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7353203/) support the hypothesis that the gut microbiota could play a role in thyroid function within the host—for instance, the altered microbiota composition in people living with thyroid disorders; germ-free rats presenting with smaller thyroids than normal [rats](https://www.cell.com/trends/endocrinology-metabolism/fulltext/S1043-2760\(19\)30107-9?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1043276019301079%3Fshowall%3Dtrue); and the prominent metabolism of thyroid hormones by gut microbiota. Intestinal dysbiosis or bacterial overgrowth, intestinal hyper-permeability, and a shift to a pro-inflammatory state are a few factors that may lead to health implications within the thyroid and its function.

That all said, most of the research on microbiota and thyroid interaction is associative, and how / if this research could translate to probiotic use is not yet known.

On an interesting and more actionable note, a [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29184537/) on probiotics showed that individuals consuming a probiotic mixture of *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium* strains 2 hours after their thyroid medication found a significantly lower adjustment requirement of T4 medication in the treatment compared to the control group, reasoning that microbiota modification *may* affect levothyroxine availability. While no significant changes in serum thyroid hormones were noted, supplemental probiotics could slightly impact dependence on thyroid medication.

### Grave's Disease / Hyperthyroidism

Interestingly, [one study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8423791/)​ found that a single-strain probiotic significantly improved multiple health markers in those with hyperthyroidism (namely Graves' Disease) when administered with methimazole (possibly through the gut-thyroid axis). However, many more rigorous clinical studies are needed to determine the specific strains and dosages that would best benefit thyroid function in those with hyperthyroidism.

### Hashimoto's Thyroiditis / Hashimoto's Disease

Because the gut microbiota greatly impacts the immune system in a multitude of ways, it is also thought to impact the thyroid through the gut-thyroid axis. Although [several studies](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10238-024-01304-4)​ have found that individuals with HT have a different gut microbiome composition than those without, studies about which bacterial genera increase during HT provide conflicting results, possibly because composition may change at different points during disease progression. More research is therefore needed to determine not only which bacteria increase or decrease during HT, but also whether these changes are the cause of HT or the result of the body trying to fight disease progression.

In addition, although probiotics have been proposed as a possible therapy for HT, a recent [meta analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10783727/)​ found mixed results of human clinical trials examining the effects of probiotics on thyroid function, and it has not been studied in those with HT specifically. All in all, more studies in humans are necessary to conclusively determine whether probiotics could mediate HT or its symptoms.

## Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)

Kindly note that VS-01™ Vaginal Synbiotic is not intended to treat, prevent, or cure any condition or disease state. Further, we have not specifically studied VS-01™ in a population with active urinary tract infections, and thus are unable to comment on any difference in effect or safety. Therefore, we would suggest consulting with your physician who can appropriately advise on the use of this product with knowledge of your complete health history.

Rather, VS-01™ is the first synbiotic clinically proven to restore a healthy vaginal microbiome and sustain regulated vaginal pH, safe for long-term use. Developed from 15+ years of breakthrough research, VS-01™ is the first vaginal synbiotic formulated with three proprietary strains of\_ L. crispatus\_ identified from over 600 candidates for their unmatched efficacy in promoting vaginal health. Our first-of-its-kind synbiotic suppository combines these strains with a rich complex of nutrients and molecules to create the ideal environment and energy source for the probiotic strains to thrive—addressing gynecological health at the source to protect and defend against disruption.

That said, as far as the literature landscape is concerned, we’ve come to know that changes in the characteristics of the vaginal microbiota resulting in the loss of normally protective bacterial genus *Lactobacillus* may [increase the risk](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5746606/) of UTI. Similarly, interventions to restore protective lactobacilli may reduce the risks of UTI. (Interestingly, vaginal microbiomes dominated by *L. crispatus* are [associated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4891990/#:~:text=colonizing%20the%20vagina.-,L.,et%20al.%2C%202009).) with decreased risk of some types of infections or conditions such as bacterial vaginosis, vaginal candidiasis, and sexually transmitted infections, as well as favorable fertility outcomes and reduced risk of adverse pregnancy events such as preterm birth.)

For example, in a [randomized, placebo-controlled trial,](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-abstract/78/5/1154/7470427?redirectedFrom=fulltext) researchers evaluated the effectiveness of both oral and intravaginal probiotic supplementation in the prevention of recurrent UTIs. Both routes of supplementation demonstrated effective reduction in recurrent symptomatic UTI episodes. Additionally, a small (n=50) randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3079401/) which administered a vaginal *L. crispatus* probiotic directly to the vagina of pre-menopausal women was associated with decreased rates of recurrent UTI compared with placebo. However, one [systematic review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34671514/) found there was not a significant difference in a probiotic reducing recurrent UTI rates compared to placebo (in premenopausal women). The authors noted more data and larger sample sizes are needed to properly determine probiotic use for UTIs.

If you would like to know more about UTIs, including common causes, prevention, and treatments, we encourage you to read our [Cultured Article](https://seed.com/cultured/category/vaginal-microbiome/), ""How Microbiome-Informed Treatment Could Revolutionize UTI Care"".

All said, while I do hope I provided helpful supplementary information on the field of probiotics and UTIs, as well as some useful information to better explain the use for and limitations of our product, research in the field is developing. In addition, it’s important to take note of differences in trial design, probiotic strains used and other ingredients, dosage, and delivery mechanism, as each may contribute to outcome variance across a similar population. We encourage you to work with your physician to determine your optimal health and wellness protocol.

## Probiotics \+ Leaky Gut / Intestinal Integrity

### NOTE:

**Compliance Reminder**: if you mention a\_ specific strain\_ that happens to be in DS-01® while discussing a disease state, you must also include research on a strain not included in our formulation, to provide a well-rounded/unbiased view on probiotics \+ medical conditions (without specifying which strain(s) mentioned are in our product).

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

Intestinal integrity was one of the primary features we considered in building our strain bank—in fact, in the early phases of our product formulation, our researchers noted that several of our strains promoted increased expression of a gene called *Nrf2, in vitro.* This gene is [implicated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6617875/) in gut-barrier integrity.

*Nrf2* is crucial to the upkeep of organ systems that often deal with environmental insults, such as the liver and intestine. With increased expression, this gene can “clean up” reactive oxygen species (ROS), compounds that are responsible for injury to the gut mucosal lining. In addition, *Nrf2* expression is associated with the production of proteins in the gut that form ‘tight junctions.’ As their name implies, tight junctions form scaffolding in the gut barrier to reinforce its’ integrity and keep out foreign materials and contaminants.

In addition, several of our strains were shown *in vitro* to increase production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), byproducts that come as a result of carbohydrate fermentation. SCFAs also maintain a healthy gut intestinal environment and gut-barrier integrity. A caveat with\_ in vitro\_ testing, however, is that, despite the ability to produce efficient preliminary results, these studies often fail to replicate the conditions of a human body. And as a company rooted in science, we often inform our members of the potential inability of *in vitro* results to replicate in real world conditions.

Further, our probiotic strains are not the only component of our product working towards maintaining a healthy gut barrier. We included a special extract from Indian pomegranate—called punicalagins—that interact with species of microbes in the gut. When consumed by gut microbes, punicalagins are transformed into urolithins, a powerful class of molecules that have been associated with decreased proinflammatory immune cell expression, lower levels of colon tissue damage, and increased production of colonic tight junction proteins.

**\[ Additional information if asking about how Leaky Gut is diagnosed or measured:** Assessing the presence of leaky gut can be done through stool [zonulin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8177645/) testing, which is typically available through at-home and in-person lab testing. Diagnostic testing via blood/stool samples or standard questionnaires can be performed to identify potential markers such as [high histamine, low DAO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8069563/), and/or the presence of [antibodies to intestinal cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7767453/); measuring [immune activation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8177645/) to bacteria can be performed as well. For example, in clinical trials, researchers can use [lactulose/mannitol testing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6687120/) to assess intestinal permeability in response to an intervention ([probiotics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8834517/)). Lactulose absorption is said to represent gut damage (mucosal integrity) and mannitol absorption is used as a measure of normal small intestine function (nutrient uptake).

However, identifying the impact of probiotics specifically on the progression of leaky gut can be challenging and involve additional primary or clinical endpoints. (Insert relevant information from [*How do probiotic benefits show up in lab results?*](https://app.getguru.com/card/cp5px5zi/How-do-probiotic-benefits-show-up-in-lab-results-))

While there are blood tests that indicate the presence of leaky gut, causes are multifactorial and the progression of this condition may need to be monitored more holistically through multiple clinical endpoints. \]

### Version 2 (deeper explanation)

### (add-on to above) How can i improve gut barrier integrity (non-probiotic)?

Aside from probiotics, I would like to share some information from scientific literature on potential ways to improve gut barrier integrity.

Unsurprisingly, diet plays a large factor on gut barrier function. One [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916523036122#ab0005)​ found the [Mediterranean diet](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/mediterranean-diet/art-20047801)​ affected barrier function genes, suggesting this diet may play a beneficial role in improving barrier function—most likely due to SCFAs. A similar [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-023-03172-2)​ found a diet higher in Omega-3 polyunsaturated fats (such as those found in seafood and nuts) led to an increase in barrier function, while a diet higher in saturated fats (such as in fast food) led to an increase in barrier dysfunction.

Further, [dietary carbohydrates](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S143842212100028X?) (sugars) can play a major role on the gut barrier. [Fiber](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6689735/)​, on one hand, promotes a stronger barrier function by allowing for bacterial fermentation to create SCFAs and also for increasing the [mucus layer](https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674\(16\)31464-7.pdf)​ to prevent pathogens from reaching the gut barrier. On the other hand, [fructose](https://journals.lww.com/hep/abstract/2021/06000/fructose_promotes_leaky_gut,_endotoxemia,_and.15.aspx)​ is a known disruptor of the gut barrier by affecting tight junction proteins. Therefore, modulating dietary factors and limiting barrier 'disruptors' could be a way to improve gut barrier integrity.

Other notable beneficial factors include partaking in [moderate exercise](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8604291/)​, increasing [vitamin D levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8004066/)​, and keeping to a [regular eating time](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8016699/)​ (i.e. not close to rest time). Reduced gut barrier integrity is also associated with certain conditions such as [inflammatory bowel disease](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41575-020-00399-w)​, [non-alcoholic fatty liver disease](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b00080), [anxiety/depression](https://gut.bmj.com/content/67/8/1555.2.abstract)​, [NSAID-induced damage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6013262/)—therefore, it may be pertinent to discuss with your healthcare provider to assess the potential causes and treatments to improve your gut barrier integrity.

## Psoriasis / Psoriatic Arthritis

### NOTE:

Note: psoriatic arthritis is arthritis \+ psoriasis—not every [psoriasis patient](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4206220/)\*\* develops psoriatic arthritis\*\*

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

**\[OPTIONAL gut-skin axis background:**

As you may know, the gut microbiome is believed to play a role in a wide variety of skin conditions by way of the gut-skin axis—the bidirectional relationship between your gut microbes and your skin. \]

The gut microbiome is believed to play a role in psoriasis \[and psoriatic arthritis\] through the gut-skin axis. Current research suggests the [disruption](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2020.589726/full)​ of the gut microbiome may play a role in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, but it’s still unclear which gut microbial species are implicated in these diseases in humans.

**\[If only psoriasis:**

In general, individuals with psoriasis have an [altered gut microbiota](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34897759/)​ abundance and diversity when compared to controls. These alterations have also been associated with [inflammation-related](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33685393/)​ indicators—suggesting dysbiosis (disruption) in the gut microbiome may be associated with psoriasis.

In fact, a [clinical trial](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10342574/)​ found probiotic \+ prebiotic supplementation in conjunction with topical psoriasis treatment led to an improvement in the [Psoriasis Area and Severity Index](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23425140/)​ (PASI, one of the best clinical tools used to measure psoriasis severity) and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). However, one [meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34938815/)​ examining 3 trials found no significant difference in PASI scores between both probiotic and control groups.

Therefore, the efficacy of probiotic (or prebiotic) use with psoriasis is still not well-understood. As shown in the trial above, it is possible probiotics *may* be beneficial with current psoriasis treatment; however, further studies and trials are needed to assess the therapeutic benefit of probiotics and which strains/dosage would be effective for psoriasis. \]

\[Psoriatic arthritis \+ probiotics: In addition, while much research has been done in cells and in mice, probiotics have had [mixed results](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37648398/)​ in interventional clinical trials in people with psoriatic arthritis. \]

## Tyramine Sensitivity

### NOTE:

*Note to SciCare specialists: Tyramine sensitivity is often mentioned in conjunction with histamine intolerance, for which we have these cards:* [Can I take DS-01 if I have a histamine intolerance? / Has DS-01 been studied in individuals with a histamine intolerance?](https://app.getguru.com/card/cAonLEoi/Can-I-take-DS01-if-I-have-a-histamine-intolerance-Has-DS01-been-studied-in-individuals-with-a-histamine-intolerance) *and* [Histamine Producing Strains / Histamine Production](https://app.getguru.com/card/cLyaoBoi/Histamine-Producing-Strains-Histamine-Production-)

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

Kindly note, tyramine levels were not one of the endpoints for which DS-01® was formulated, nor has DS-01® been tested in those with tyramine sensitivity; we are therefore unable to comment on any difference in effect, utility, or safety in this regard.

That said, I'd be happy to share the current research perspective on tyramine and the gut microbiome.

In general, [tyramine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK563197/)​ increases the release of other neurotransmitters (such as norepinephrine or dopamine); in high amounts, this can lead to headaches, blood pressure spikes, or other unfavorable health outcomes, though at low levels, it may also help [regulate](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article-abstract/77/2/107/5084469) ​the immune and nervous system.

Interestingly, different strains within the same species of bacteria can have opposite effects on tyramine. For example, *Lactiplantibacillus plantarum* has been shown to both [increase](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3492074/)​ and [decrease](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34925777/)​ tyramine levels in foods. However, the impact of probiotic strains on tyramine levels has primarily been tested in vitro or in [foods](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S088915752400019X), rather than in humans. Thus, rigorous human clinical trials are needed to determine how probiotics could potentially affect tyramine levels in humans.

With all of this in mind, we would encourage you to consult with your personal physician to assess your degree of \[histamine intolerance and\] tyramine sensitivity and to advise on the need for avoiding certain strains of probiotics. You and your doctor can view our entire strain list [here](https://seed.com/reference/syn-wk): under the ""Formulation"" heading, you can either click on each subheading, or you can click on ""How to Read Our Label"" to see our entire strain list.

## Saccharomyces (S. boulardii)

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

*Saccharomyces*, especially the species *S. boulardii*, has been noted for beneficial effects such as [reducing pediatric acute diarrhea](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36086703/)​ or antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) in [adults](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28592037/)​.

That said, further studies and more rigorous trials are needed to assess the efficacy of *S. boulardii,* as an additional [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22472744/)​ found *S. boulardii* was not effective in preventing AAD. [Another](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18949181/)​ study indicated a similar result.

In addition, there are some concerns regarding the safety of *Saccharomyces*. For example, one [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8314839/)​ found roughly 40% of *Saccharomyces* fungemia (fungi in blood) patients were using a *S. boulardii* probiotic. Importantly, this [review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666991920000251?via%3Dihub#bib0070)​ noted risk for *Saccharomyces* fungemia is associated with immunocompromised/critical care patients and elderly subjects.

In contrast, there are other [studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32472262/) which indicate the safety of *S. boulardii*—highlighting the importance of strain specificity, as these generally identify a specific strain. (While science indicates that benefits, efficacy, and safety of probiotics are strain-specific, a number of *S. boulardii* products do not mention the included strain.)

As it stands, the use of *Saccharomyces* probiotics remain controversial; thus, further human studies are needed to more widely confirm the efficacy and safety of *Saccharomyces* probiotics.

## Colon Cancer

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

\[Colon Cancer PREVENTION specifically:

To start, kindly note that DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied for the specific endpoint of colon cancer prevention; therefore, we are unable to comment on any difference in effect or utility in this regard. DS-01® is not considered or regulated as a therapeutic and is therefore not intended to treat or prevent any condition or disease state, including cancer.

Rather, DS-01® is formulated to provide support for digestive and systemic health with core benefits across gastrointestinal function, gut barrier integrity, immune health, cardiovascular health, micronutrient synthesis, and dermatological health.

That said, I would be happy to summarize the [current research perspective](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39160377/)​ on the potential use of probiotics to prevent colon cancer.

Extensive [research to date](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39160377/) has shown that probiotics have the potential to limit the initiation and spread of colon cancer by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria and keeping cancer-inducing bacteria from settling in the intestine. Additionally, probiotics may promote the gut's destruction of cancerous cells or reduce gut inflammation so that the immune system can better identify and destroy cancer cells. Probiotics can also reduce oxidative stress and the prevalence of carcinogenic compounds in the gut.

Unfortunately, all of the studies to date about the impacts of probiotics on the development of colon cancer have been done using laboratory cells or in mice. So, while we don't know if these same benefits extend to humans, it is a very promising area of study. \]

### Version 3 (deepest \+ most scientific)

DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied or evaluated in individuals with cancer, or who have undergone any form of chemotherapy or other cancer treatment, so we cannot comment directly on any possible differences in effect in that regard. That said, DS-01® should be safe to consume during and after cancer treatment, and it may provide probiotic and prebiotic support for healthy overall gut function.

The safety and efficacy of probiotics for people with cancer has been widely [studied](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0923753419365986). Scientific inquiry has highlighted the relationship between the gut microbiota and colon cancer, and how the use of probiotics can have a future impact on adverse events which occur during this disease and the treatment of it.

Multiple mechanisms have been proposed for probiotics’ growing role in cancer treatment and prevention, including [immunomodulation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7350223/), [epigenetic changes](https://karger.com/mee/article/1/1/60/188981/Epigenetics-Probiotic-Metabolites-and-Colon-Cancer), [drug activity potentiation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27221111/), [antioxidant](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22161238/) function, and [suppression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31682995/) of cancer precursors. Probiotics can stimulate the body's immune mechanisms by inducing the production of vital immune cells, Toll-like receptors, cytokines, chemokines, and regulatory T-cells that are part of our [immune defense system](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/496426).

Although there is no definitive evidence to claim that probiotics are effective in people with colon cancer, literature has found that probiotics can significantly reduce the incidence of diarrhea, frequency of daily bowel movements, and [side-effects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8922230/) associated with chemotherapy and radiation.

In addition, some probiotics, when properly dosed and administered, can have possible positive action on immune modulation of the gastrointestinal tract and on inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. Some probiotic strains [can reduce](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6204245/) the incidence of postoperative inflammation in cancer patients despite their suppressed immunity.

Of relevance, chemotherapy is a known microbiome disruptor, which affects gut microbiota composition in several ways. Diarrhea is a common and often poorly-managed side effect. Some of the most promising outcomes for probiotics in the oncology field is around their alleviation of [chemotherapy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24618152) and [radiotherapy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5456391/) induced diarrhea, but [reviews](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6513393/) emphasize the low certainty of these conclusions and call for larger, more rigorous trials. A recent [review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6247548/) of clinical studies that used probiotics and other adjunct treatments to chemotherapy showed that probiotics were reported to reduce the burden of treatment-induced intestinal mucositis and diarrhea.

That said, while insightful, most of this evidence needs further clinical and mechanistic evaluation under rigorous protocols—particularly in human models—to be considered for utility in cancer treatments.

Probiotics in the world of cancer therapies is a difficult one to navigate and individual responses to probiotics can and do vary. We would advise that you consult with your oncologist before adding any product to your regime (including ours) as they may advise with the added context of your personal health history and ongoing treatment plan.

## Probiotics \+ IBS

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

DS-01® is regulated by the FDA as a dietary supplement, and as such, is not intended to diagnose, treat, prevent, or cure any condition or disease state. As we are unable to comment on the utility of DS-01® with respect to specific medical states or conditions, we would suggest consulting with your physician who can appropriately advise on DS-01® administration while taking into account your complete health history.

In terms of the clinical landscape of populations with digestive challenges, research [suggests](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9116469/) that probiotics may alleviate the frequency and severity of flatulence, slow down the transit time of the colon, support bowel movement regularity, improve stool consistency, and aid a better overall quality of life.

With this in mind, DS-01® was recently the subject of an [Investigational New Drug](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fda-authorizes-new-ind-to-evaluate-impact-of-multi-strain-probiotic-ds-01-on-gut-microbiota-of-patients-with-ibs-301139955.html) (IND) application and [clinical trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04598295?term=seed+health+SH&draw=2&rank=2) at Harvard Medical School \- Beth Israel Deaconess to assess its impact on individuals who experience occasional digestive challenges. Include information from: [Can you tell me about the results from your clinical trial on Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)?](https://app.getguru.com/card/cMz88a7i/Can-you-tell-me-about-the-results-from-your-clinical-trial-on-Irritable-Bowel-Syndrome-IBS)

## Interstitial cystitis (IC)

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

To start, kindly note DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied in individuals living with interstitial cystitis specifically; therefore, we are unable to comment on any difference in effect or utility within this population. DS-01® also is not considered or regulated as a therapeutic and is therefore not intended to treat or prevent any condition or disease state.

Rather, DS-01® is formulated to provide support for digestive and systemic health with core benefits across gastrointestinal function, gut barrier integrity, immune health, cardiovascular health, micronutrient synthesis, and dermatological health.

That said, I'd be happy to share with you the current research perspective on the gut microbiome and Interstitial Cystitis (IC)/Bladder Pain Syndrome (BPS).

[IC/BPS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570588/)​ is characterized by urinary issues such as frequency, urgency, and pelvic pain. As such, early investigations of the potential impact of the microbiome in IC/BPS focused on the [urinary microbiome.](https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.711746)​ While many of these studies found differences in the urinary microbiomes of those with and without IC/BPS, these differences are [not consistent](https://doi.org/10.1111/bju.16439)​ across studies (for example, some studies found higher abundance of lactobacilli in individuals with IC/BPS, while other studies found the opposite).

Interestingly, one study also found differences in the [gut microbiomes](https://doi.org/10.1038/srep26083)​ of those with and without IC/BPS, while [another study](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-69543-9)​ used genetic analysis to determine whether these differences in gut microbiome could potentially cause IC/BPS. Though both of these studies were promising, more rigorous experimental research is needed to confirm whether targeting the gut microbiome (by using probiotics, for example) could be used to prevent or alleviate IC/BPS.

With all this said, we would ultimately recommend consulting with a physician who can provide personalized guidance based on your unique medical history and presenting symptoms.

## Psyllium husk / Metamucil

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

There are no known interactions between probiotics like DS-01® Daily Synbiotic and other dietary supplements; therefore, DS-01® should be fine to combine with supplements, including \[**psyllium husk / Metamucil\].**

However, as\*\*  \*\*\[**psyllium husk / Metamucil\]** is known to promote laxation, it is possible DS-01® capsules may eject prematurely and appear partially intact in the stool—meaning the strains may not have been adequately delivered to the colon. This in mind, we would suggest separating intake as much as possible, i.e. your \[**psyllium husk / Metamucil\]** in the morning and DS-01® in the evening, if possible.

All said, we would also suggest consulting with your health care provider to determine the best course of action regarding your supplement routine.

### Version 2 (deeper explanation)

There are no known interactions between probiotics like DS-01® Daily Synbiotic and other dietary supplements; therefore, DS-01® should be fine to combine with supplements, including \[**psyllium husk / Metamucil\].**

However, as\*\*  \*\*\[**psyllium husk / Metamucil\]** is known to promote laxation, it is possible DS-01® capsules may eject prematurely and appear partially intact in the stool—meaning the strains may not have been adequately delivered to the colon. This in mind, we would suggest separating intake as much as possible, i.e. your \[**psyllium husk / Metamucil\]** in the morning and DS-01® in the evening, if possible.

For context, DS-01® is not intended to negate or reduce the need for fiber, and additional fiber would not remove positive effects in DS-01®. While the FDA recommends 25g of fiber per day, research may indicate that number should be [at least 40g](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9268622/).

**\[OPTIONAL ADD ON to explain how psyllium husk works:** [Psyllium husk](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms20020433) is a water soluble fiber that works as a 'bulking agent' to draw moisture into the stool easing defecation. It is not known to have any negative interactions with probiotic organisms—rather works to support a healthy digestive system.**\]**

All said, we would also suggest consulting with your health care provider to determine the best course of action regarding your supplement routine.

### Psyllium husk / Metamucil

#### Version 3 (deepest \+ most scientific)

For context, DS-01® is not intended to negate or reduce the need for fiber, and additional fiber would not remove positive effects in DS-01®. While the FDA recommends 25g of fiber per day, only an [estimated 5%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6124841/) of US adults achieve this amount. To close the fiber gap and reap all of the [benefits](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(18\)31809-9/fulltext) dietary fiber has to offer, consider aiming for more than this recommended amount–[research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9268622/) indicates 40g.

**\[OPTIONAL ADD ON to explain how psyllium husk works:** [Psyllium husk](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms20020433) is a water soluble fiber that works as a 'bulking agent' to draw moisture into the stool easing defecation.

In fact, [a 2017 comprehensive literature review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27863994/) exploring randomized controlled trials on fiber supplements reports that psyllium husk (Metamucil) offers a broader range of positive benefits for cholesterol, blood glucose, and stool regularity compared to other well-researched fiber supplements, including large-particle wheat bran, guar gum, and beta-glucan from oats.**\]**

Interestingly, while [less is known](https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2019.33.1_supplement.lb298) about the possible, specific synergistic effects of oral probiotic and psyllium fiber supplementation specifically, a 2021 randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled [trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8221300/) demonstrated that psyllium husk may also elicit its’ benefits on the host due to modulation of the host microbiome.

All said, we would also suggest consulting with your health care provider to determine the best course of action regarding your supplement routine.

## Fermented Food / Bevs vs Probiotics

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

Many fermented foods and beverages can be nutritious, tasty additions to your daily diet.

That said, just because something contains live microorganisms doesn’t mean it satisfies the [definition](https://isappscience.org/for-consumers/learn/probiotics/) of a probiotic—which requires the microorganisms to be alive at the time of consumption, to have a demonstrated health benefit, and to be administered in specific amounts.

In contrast, fermented foods generally do not conduct testing to confirm the specific strains present in their products—and thus cannot reliably relate benefits, as these are strain-specific—nor do they confirm whether a specific strain is present in an adequate dosage, or whether the bacteria are even alive upon consumption. This is why the microorganisms in fermented food or beverages are generally said to be [live dietary microbes](https://isappscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LiveDietaryMicrobes-English.pdf), which do not require any specific characterization, nor do they have any scientific evidence directly linking their use to a conferred health benefit.

So, while fermented foods and beverages can be a great addition to your diet, it is important to keep in mind that they may not confer the same benefits that a scientifically-validated probiotic supplement may. If you’d like to dive deeper into this topic, check out our cultured article on this topic, [here](https://seed.com/cultured/fermented-foods-vs-probiotics/).

**\[OPTIONAL ADD ON \- ""I heard live probiotics are better"":** It's true that probiotics are most effective when they make it to your colon, alive. DS-01® does include live probiotics (they are simply lyophilized––similar to freeze-dried––and reactivate when they come in contact with water). We've also done [extensive testing](https://seed.com/cultured/cfu-vs-afu-whats-the-difference-and-which-is-better/) to make sure these live probiotics survive shipping, storage, and digestion for precision delivery to your colon at clinically relevant dosages.

### Version 2 (deeper explanation)

While it's certainly possible for a fermented food or beverage to meet the scientific criteria for a probiotic, most fall short, and therefore do not fall under this category or supply the same benefits.

For some context, the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics ([ISAPP](https://isappscience.org/for-consumers/learn/probiotics/)) defines a probiotics “live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host.”

Relating this to a fermented food–while you may have ingested some bacteria from this, it’s typically unknown which strains, in which quantities, whether these strains are alive at the time of consumption, and if they have been studied, in those quantities, to actually have a benefit to your body. More likely than not, consuming fermented foods is a source of [live dietary microbes](https://isappscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LiveDietaryMicrobes-English.pdf), rather than being characterized as a probiotic.

This is not to say that you shouldn’t eat or drink fermented things. Many fermented foods and beverages are extremely nutritious, very tasty additions to your daily diet. The greatest distinction between a probiotic supplement and live dietary microbes from fermented foods is that the foods are not necessarily reliable sources of beneficial, effective, and live bacteria in adequate amounts—many fermented foods would have to be consumed in relatively large quantities in order to generate a potential health benefit.

All said, fermented foods can be a great addition to your diet—though, it is important to keep in mind, they may not necessarily confer the same benefits a scientifically-studied probiotic supplement will.

### Version 3 (deepest \+ most scientific)

While it's certainly possible for a fermented food or beverage to meet the scientific criteria for a probiotic, most fall short. For some context, the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics ([ISAPP](https://isappscience.org/for-consumers/learn/probiotics/)) definition of a probiotic is “live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host.”

While you may have ingested some bacteria from eating a fermented food, it’s typically unknown which strains, in which quantities, if the strains are still alive at the time of consumption, and if those strains have been studied, in those quantities, to actually have a benefit to your body. More likely than not, consuming fermented foods is a source of [live dietary microbes](https://isappscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LiveDietaryMicrobes-English.pdf), rather than being characterized as a probiotic.

Live dietary microbes (LDM) do not require any specific characterization, nor do the have scientific evidence which demonstrates a specific health benefit. Further, there is no defined dose–in fact, LDMs would need to be consumed in large quantities to generate a potential health benefit.

It is also important to understand that most fermented foods are made with live microbes, but some processing steps may kill or remove the live microbes.

All of this in mind, this is not to say that you shouldn’t eat or drink fermented things–many fermented foods and beverages are extremely nutritious, very tasty additions to your daily diet.

The [best sources](https://isappscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LiveDietaryMicrobes-English.pdf) of live dietary microbes are raw vegetables and fruit (unpeeled), and fermented dairy and vegetables (untreated after fermentation), which contain low amounts of added sugars, and are found in the refrigerated section of a market.

Interestingly, one [study](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674\(21\)00754-6) actually found that a group of individuals who steadily increased their consumption to 4-6 servings of fermented foods (including: fermented dairy products, fermented vegetables, fermented non-alcoholic drinks) per day, over a 10 week intervention period, saw both an increase in their microbiota diversity and a decrease in numerous markers of inflammation. However, the sample size of this study was low and further human studies are needed to examine the causality of this relationship.

All said, a diet rich in fermented foods can be a great addition to your diet—though, it is important to keep in mind, they may not necessarily confer the same benefits a scientifically-studied probiotic supplement will.

## General Strain Specificity Education

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

It is important to emphasize that benefits for probiotic organisms are strain-specific. This is because benefits are clinically assessed \+ demonstrated at the strain level; and, due to the significant variance between strains, this data cannot simply be applied beyond the strain studied.

For some context, *Bifidobacterium* is what’s called a **genus**—that is, a ‘group’. Within each genus, such as the *Bifidobacterium* genus, there can be multiple **species**, such as *Bifidobacterium longum* and *Bifidobacterium breve*. Then, within each species of bacteria, there are **strains** (like *Bifidobacterium longum* SD-BB536-JP, *Bifidobacterium longum* HRVD90b-US\*,\* etc\*.).\*

There can be hundreds, or even thousands, of strains in a single species. And just like a golden retriever and a french bulldog (both categorized as *Canis lupus familiaris* species) are incredibly different, these strains of bacteria can also vary significantly.

This is why data (e.g. benefits) collected on a single strain cannot simply be extrapolated across an entire genus or species—and why strain specificity is an important topic in probiotics, as strains are directly related to effects.

### Version 2 (deeper explanation)

The concept of biological taxonomy is the science of classification or categorization. In this system, organisms are classified in different levels based on similar characteristics, beginning with grouping based on the most broad characteristics (*domain*) all the way down to the most specific ones (*species*). Within these levels, there is a *genus* which is a higher, more broad category (ex: genus *Bifidobacterium*), with each genus containing multiple *species* (ex: species *Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium breve*, etc.); and each species in turn containing multiple *strains* (ex: *Bifidobacterium longum* SD-BB536-JP, *Bifidobacterium longum* HRVD90b-US\*,\* etc\*.\*). Out of these three categories, **strain** is the most specific and narrow category.

Now, **\[relating this back to the probiotic definition\]** we can see how the importance of *strain* specificity comes in, as the evidence of health benefits is assessed at the strain-level. And, because of the depth of variance between each *strain* in a given *species* (and each *species* in a given *genus*), the results of these *strain* studies can not simply be extrapolated across an entire *species* or *genus.*

**\[OPTIONAL ADD ON re products:** In considering the consumer world, this means that if the evidence of a demonstrated health benefit is established on a *strain*\-level, then a product identifying only a *genus* or *species* of microorganism could not accurately claim there is evidence that any benefit would be demonstrated with its use.**\]**

### Why does your Lactobacillus name look different / I can't find XX species/strain in your list?

In 2020, the genus *Lactobacillus* underwent some [naming changes](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem/10.1099/ijsem.0.004107)​ to better classify bacteria within the genus according to updated information from whole genome sequencing. For example, *Lactobacillus reuteri* was [reclassified](https://isappscience.org/new-names-for-important-probiotic-lactobacillus-species/)​ into *Limosilactobacillus reuteri.* The bacteria themselves have not changed, only the name. Thus, these two names are synonymous with one using the updated classification and the other using the older classification.

**\[If asking about Seed specific strain naming: (NOTE: this does not apply to the HRVDXX strains)**

In regards to how strains are listed on our label, it may be slightly different than how they are mentioned in the literature.

Taking *Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus* SD-GG-BE for example—"SD" represents “Seed”, "GG" is the name often found in literature, and "BE" represents where the strain is banked which in this case is Belgium. In the literature, it will often simply be described as *Lacticaseibacillus* (or *Lactobacillus*) *rhamnosus* GG. \]

## Best diet for the microbiome / how diet supports the microbiome

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

Interestingly, dietary intervention has been [shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9455721/) to have beneficial effects for both developing and maintaining a diverse microbiome. In short, eating a diet which is [high in dietary fiber](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9787832/), primarily [plant-based](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6478664/), and includes fermented foods, can make a positive impact on your gut microbiome. If you’re interested in learning more about how to eat with your gut microbiome in mind, check out our Cultured article, [‘Reader’s Digest: What Is the “Best” Diet for Your Gut?’](https://seed.com/cultured/eating-for-your-gut/).

All things considered, there is no one-size-fits-all diet, and we always encourage consulting your doctor when considering making a change to your diet, as they are best able to advise with the knowledge of your personal health history.

### Version 2 (deeper explanation)

Dietary intervention has been [shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9455721/) to have beneficial effects for both developing and maintaining a diverse microbiome. Eating a diet which is [high in dietary fiber](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9787832/), is primarily [plant-based](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6478664/), and includes fermented foods, can make a positive impact on your gut microbiome.

Some specific science-backed recommendations on what to eat for your microbiome include:

* Prioritizing a [diverse range](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.00031-18) of foods: different microbes feed on different dietary components\!

## Intestinal Bacterial / Methanogen Overgrowth \- SIBO/IMO

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

Kindly note, VS-01™ Vaginal Synbiotic has not been studied in the context of cytolytic vaginosis (CV) so we are unable to comment on the efficacy in this regard.

In regards to the literature landscape surrounding CV at large, though it is primarily characterized as an overgrowth of lactobacilli, unfortunately, cytolytic vaginosis is an understudied condition. That said, it is unclear if the [overgrowth of lactobacilli](https://jsstd.org/content/102/2022/0/1/pdf/JSSTD-41-2021.pdf) leads to CV or if the overgrowth occurs due to CV—thus, there is not enough evidence to conclusively attribute overgrowth of lactobacilli to the development of CV.

With this in mind, we always suggest individuals with specific concerns to consult their healthcare provider before adding a new product (including ours) to their routine, as they can most appropriately advise on the utility and suitability of the product.

**\[Optional add-on, if the member is asking if VS-01™ can lead to or cause cytolytic vaginosis:** All said, Cytolytic Vaginosis was not observed as adverse outcomes in our clinical trial on VS-01™. In addition, the probiotic strains in VS-01™ are representative of naturally-occuring *L. crispatus* genomic diversity, and are associated with stable vaginal microbiomes. This all in mind, VS-01™ use is unlikely to lead to CV. \]

### Version 2 (deeper explanation)

To begin, do note DS-01® has not been studied in individuals living with a diagnosis of SIBO, and the decontamination of bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine was not an endpoint we targeted in forming our product. Further, DS-01® is not intended is not intended to treat, prevent or cure any condition or disease state, such as SIBO. Therefore, I am unable to comment on any differences in effect or utility in this regard.

For some background, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) develops when [normal homeostatic mechanisms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3099351/#:~:text=Small%20intestinal%20bacterial%20overgrowth%20\(SIBO\)%20is%20defined%20as%20the%20presence,%2C%20nutritional%20deficiencies%2C%20and%20osteoporosis.) (i.e. gastric acids, normal GI motility and structure, and immune function) that control enteric bacterial populations are disrupted. As the name suggests, it’s what occurs when the small intestine becomes overgrown with bacteria.

In addition to the absolute number of organisms, the type of microbial flora that overgrow in the small intestine plays an important role in the manifestation of signs and symptoms of overgrowth, and often leads to differential treatments.

Some of the [symptoms](https://www.medicinenet.com/small_intestinal_bacterial_overgrowth_sibo/article.htm) of SIBO include, but are not limited to, post-meal bloating; increased, malodorous flatulence; changes to stool ([looser](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7366247/) in hydrogen-dominant SIBO; [constipation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7366247/) in methane-dominant SIBO); and nutrient absorption issues (which can result in weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, and macronutrient malabsorption). While less studied, some individuals [report](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/an-in-depth-overview-of-the-three-types-of-sibo-hydrogen-methane-hydrogen-sulfide#:~:text=The%20main%20symptoms%20of%20SIBO,more%20likely%20to%20cause%20constipation.) neurocognitive effects like brain fog, confusion, anxiety and depression; as well as allergic and topical presentations (i.e., rosacea, eczema, and food intolerances).

As the [research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32754400/) on SIBO advances, primary care physicians continue to develop their understanding of the diagnosis and management of the condition.

**\[OPTIONAL INFO on diagnostic testing:** The most common diagnostic method due to its low cost and limited invasiveness is measuring products of fermentation with [breath testing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10496284/). However, this testing method has limited sensitivity and specificity, and does not identify all fermentation byproducts (for example, hydrogen sulfide, in most breath tests).

Historically, gastroenterologists have chosen to aspirate the [jejunum](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2295385/) for bacteria; however, this comes with its own unique challenges, particularly that the sample taken may not represent the overgrowth present, and there is a high risk of contamination during and after the sampling.\]

Current [treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7386065/) usually consists of oral antibiotics, and dose will vary depending on the form of SIBO an individual presents with. Uniquely, SIBO patients are often prescribed antibiotics that selectively operate in the GI tract (i.e., rifaximin) and do not get absorbed by the body. As a consequence, they are [less likely](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2017/0215/p258.html#:~:text=TOLERABILITY,because%20of%20no%20systemic%20absorption.) to cause systemic issues associated with antibiotic use.

However, since any antibiotic [may still come](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4311309/) with associated risks, and some individuals may be reluctant to use antibiotics, alternative therapies are being [explored](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33074705/), including the use of [probiotics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28267052). The aforementioned meta-analysis, which summarized 18 clinical trials, suggested that probiotics may be an effective management strategy for SIBO by reducing bacterial overgrowths, decreasing hydrogen concentrations, and mitigating common symptoms, including abdominal pain.

High-quality trials of probiotics in SIBO are still somewhat limited, so strain- and dosage-specific protocols have yet to be defined.

For example, one [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19352343/) on the spore-forming microorganism *Bacillus clausii* produced a rate of normalization of hydrogen breath tests that was comparable to antibiotics. In another [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12038039/), *Lactobacillus casei* and *L. acidophilus* strains proved effective in treating chronic diarrhea related to bacterial overgrowth, while [another](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21381407/) showed efficacy in patients with SIBO and functional intestinal distention. However, it is challenging to compare results or glean a general consensus from these studies given their differences in study populations, probiotic species, clinical outcomes, number of study participants, and shortcomings in study design.

Other treatment options may include [dietary changes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9198866/), [herbal antimicrobials](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7748159/), and even [fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9198866/).

Ultimately, because each SIBO patient has a unique ecosystem, there is no blanket recommendation on which probiotic strains are best for SIBO management. As with any supplement, individual responses to probiotics can and do vary, so it it is often trial and error to determine which strains will be beneficial for each patient/individual.

With all of this information known, we ultimately recommend your decision to begin/continue use of DS-01® be made in conjunction with your primary care physician, as they have the most knowledge of your personal health history and unique manifestation of SIBO.

### Version 3 (deepest \+ most scientific)

To begin, do note DS-01® has not been studied in individuals living with a diagnosis of SIBO, and the decontamination of bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine was not an endpoint we targeted in forming our product. Further, DS-01® is not intended is not intended to treat, prevent or cure any condition or disease state, such as SIBO. Therefore, I am unable to comment on any differences in effect or utility in this regard.

For some background, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) develops when [normal homeostatic mechanisms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3099351/#:~:text=Small%20intestinal%20bacterial%20overgrowth%20\(SIBO\)%20is%20defined%20as%20the%20presence,%2C%20nutritional%20deficiencies%2C%20and%20osteoporosis.) (i.e. gastric acids, normal GI motility and structure, and immune function) that control enteric bacterial populations are disrupted. As the name suggests, it’s what occurs when the small intestine becomes overgrown with bacteria. SIBO falls under a broader umbrella term of digestive tract dysbiosis, which simply means an imbalance of bacteria, fungus, and other organisms in the digestive system. Dysbiosis can also occur in the large intestine—however, SIBO is unique in that under normal circumstances, the small intestine should have a relatively low concentration of bacteria. For context, the upper small intestine would typically have less than 103 organisms/mL of microorganisms, but in SIBO, these populations can [often exceed 105–106](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?journal=Gastroenterology&title=The+diagnosis+of+small+bowel+bacterial+overgrowth:+reliability+of+jejunal+culture+and+inadequacy+of+breath+hydrogen+testing&author=GR+Corrazza&author=MG+Menozzi&author=A+Strocchi&volume=98&publication_year=1990&pages=302-309&pmid=2295385&).

In addition to the absolute number of organisms, the type of microbial flora that overgrow in the small intestine plays an important role in the manifestation of signs and symptoms of overgrowth, and often leads to differential treatments.

Some of these [symptoms](https://www.medicinenet.com/small_intestinal_bacterial_overgrowth_sibo/article.htm) include, but are not limited to, postprandial bloating; increased, malodorous flatulence; changes to stool ([looser](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7366247/) in hydrogen-dominant SIBO; [constipation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7366247/) in methane-dominant SIBO); nutrient absorption issues (which can result in weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, and macronutrient malabsorption). While less studied, some individuals [report](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/an-in-depth-overview-of-the-three-types-of-sibo-hydrogen-methane-hydrogen-sulfide#:~:text=The%20main%20symptoms%20of%20SIBO,more%20likely%20to%20cause%20constipation.) neurocognitive effects like brain fog, confusion, anxiety and depression and allergic and topical presentations (i.e., rosacea, eczema, and food intolerances).

As the [research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32754400/) on SIBO advances, primary care physicians continue to develop their understanding of the diagnosis and management of the condition.

Technically, SIBO is not a condition itself—but rather, a lab finding, based on a glucose or lactulose breath test. The most common diagnostic method, due to its low cost and limited invasiveness, is measuring products of fermentation with [breath testing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10496284/), though it has limited sensitivity and specificity and does not identify all fermentation byproducts (i.e., hydrogen sulfide).

With all of this information known, we ultimately recommend your decision to continue use of DS-01® be made in conjunction with your primary care physician, as they have the most knowledge of your personal health history and unique manifestation of SIBO.

**\[OPTIONAL ADD IN: SIBO / IBS connection:** An interesting point to note that, in theory, individuals can test positive for SIBO but not present with any typical symptoms. So, unlike IBS—which is also not considered a condition but instead a set of digestive symptoms which may include bloating, GI discomfort, and changes to stool—SIBO has a formalized test associated with it, whereas IBS does not (making it somewhat more concrete to diagnose).

Patients who test positive for SIBO may have IBS symptoms, but the reverse is not always true. However, it has been [observed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29761234/) that more than one-third of IBS patients test positive for SIBO. \]

**\[OPTIONAL ADD IN: CONCERNS ABOUT PRECISION RELEASE:**

DS-01® has not been studied in individuals living with a diagnosis of SIBO, and the decontamination of bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine was not an endpoint we targeted in forming our product. Further, DS-01® is not intended to treat, prevent or cure any condition or disease state, such as SIBO. Therefore, I am unable to comment on any differences in effect or utility in this regard.

Having said that, we have specially designed our registered 2-in-1 capsule delivery technology, ViaCap®—which is a proprietary capsule-in-capsule system we developed to safeguard the viability of the probiotic organisms in DS-01® through digestion—for complete, precision release delivery to the colon.

In this 2-in-1 design, the inner capsule (which houses our probiotic formula) is nested within an outer capsule containing the free floating prebiotic powder. This separation of the probiotics from the prebiotics helps ensure shelf stability, and bacterial viability. Further, this outer capsule acts as a barrier to oxygen, moisture, and heat—avoiding the need for refrigeration of DS-01®.

To understand how this delivery technology performs, we've tested this system in the Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem ([**SHIME**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK500150/)®)--the closest system developed to model digestion and the gut. It is intended to recreate the physiological conditions and biological processes representative of a healthy human gastrointestinal tract. Based on the results of this *in vitro* testing, the probiotic dose is fully released at the end of the small intestine for complete delivery to the colon.

As probiotics are most effective when they make it to your colon alive, this nested capsule technology is a vital aspect of DS-01®. However, we've not not tested our product specifically within the context of SIBO, as mentioned—so we are unable to comment on any potential differences in potency or efficacy profiles of the ViaCap® delivery technology. What I can offer is that the green acid-resistant vegan outer capsule is made of hypromellose, water, and chlorophyllin, all ingredients which are not known to be fermented by large or small intestinal bacteria. \]

## Sleep / energy levels / fatigue

### Sleep

Just as the circadian rhythm (your sleep/wake cycle) can affect the microbiome, the microbiome, in return, appears to affect the [circadian rhythm.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867414012367)​ The gut microbiome produces metabolites that influence signaling pathways in your gut that help coordinate digestive, immunological, and endocrine functions​.

Interestingly, the scientific [literature](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6290721/pdf/fpsyt-09-00669.pdf) surrounding microbiome and sleep suggest that sleep loss and circadian misalignment in humans could be associated with dysbiosis, and therefore, in some cases, probiotic supplementation may be a potentially helpful therapy option. A double-blind, placebo-controlled [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6445894/pdf/fpsyt-10-00164.pdf) found that a probiotic containing *Lactobacillus fermentum* LF16, *L. rhamnosus* LR06, *L. plantarum* LP01, and *Bifidobacterium longum* BL04 contributed positively to mood state and improvement of sleep quality.

### Fatigue

In general, current understanding of fatigue indicates it may result from a number of [different lifestyle factors](https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/fatigue/basics/causes/sym-20050894) such as diet, physical activity levels, and sleep, as well as some medical conditions, among other elements. Currently there are no scientific studies which demonstrate probiotics as causative agents of fatigue.

Interestingly, based on available research, probiotics may actually have a positive impact on fatigue, particularly in post-infectious or chronic fatigue. For example, one clinical trial with [post-infectious fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10221065/) and another trial with fatigue associated with [long COVID](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2021.756177/full) showed the group receiving probiotics reported a lower incidence of chronic fatigue. That said, additional research is certainly needed to properly understand the impact or relationship between probiotics strains on fatigue.

That said, while current research may not indicate a link, we certainly believe personal experiences are important. If you feel the fatigue you are experiencing may be adverse, it may be pertinent to discuss this with your physician to ensure an evaluation of contributing factors.

**\[more on long covid here:** [Long-COVID / ACE2 Expression](https://app.getguru.com/card/TB9BLkqc/LongCOVID-ACE2-Expression)**\]**

### probiotics \<\> side effects / acclimation

To note, your body is an ecosystem, and the introduction of any new species into an ecosystem requires adaptation. As with any new diet, product, or change, you may experience a temporary acclimation period—this can be very normal.

However, acclimation effects are generally confined to the gastrointestinal system and include things like mild changes to stool patterns, bloating or gas. This in mind, kindly note that \[sleep disturbance / insomnia / disruption to circadian rhythm / fatigue\] is not an effect expected of acclimation, nor of probiotic use in general.

Notably, as there are many potential causes to\*\* \[[sleep disruptions](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/11429-sleep-disorders) and [circadian rhythm alterations](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/circadian-rhythm-disorders/causes)\]\*\*, we would recommend an informed discussion with your physician if you feel any effects are adverse, as they may most appropriately advise with your unique medical history in mind.

**\[Refer to: [I am feeling \[UNCOMMON acclimation symptom\] is this normal?](https://app.getguru.com/card/TokBo48c/I-am-feeling-UNCOMMON-acclimation-symptom-is-this-normal-) / [My child is feeling \[UNCOMMON acclimation effect\], is this normal?](https://app.getguru.com/card/TG45rjzc/My-child-is-feeling-UNCOMMON-acclimation-effect-is-this-normal-) \]**

## Probiotic Gummies/Gummy Products \+ Viability / Survivability

Overall, research into the survivability of probiotic gummies is fairly limited, especially compared to the immense amount of research done on probiotic capsules.

While likely not as robust as capsules or encapsulated powders, there is evidence to suggest that some gummy probiotics can survive digestion and confer [gastrointestinal effects](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8912314). However, there is minimal research examining lactic acid bacteria-based probiotic gummies \*in vivo—\*many trials use spore-forming probiotics (such as [*Heyndrickxia coagulans*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39071473/)), or studies were conducted [*in vitro*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121532/). In addition, there don’t appear to be any published studies comparing the survivability of probiotic gummies vs. powders and/or capsules, directly.

For example, this [study](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/1127321/fmicb-14-1127321-HTML-r2/image_m/fmicb-14-1127321-t001.jpg) analyzed the microbial content of 21 commercially available products of various formats, including capsule, lyophilized powder, drops, vial, oral dispersible granules, and tablets—but not gummies.

Overall, gummy probiotic survivability depends on several factors, including the type of probiotic strains used, the temperature and humidity the product is exposed to during storage and manufacturing, properties of non-probiotic ingredients used, and the water content in the final product.

### Temperature \+ Storage

For example, regarding temperature, as noted in [this study](https://www.myfoodresearch.com/uploads/8/4/8/5/84855864/_32__fr-2020-731_kamil_1.pdf), the survival rate of \*L. plantarum \*Dad-13 in gummies significantly decreased with longer *in vitro* gastric simulations—44.3% reduction after 2 hours and 88.1% reduction after 4 hours compared to initial cell counts.

Further, the gummy format is susceptible to major influences from storage conditions—[*L. plantarum*](https://www.myfoodresearch.com/uploads/8/4/8/5/84855864/_32__fr-2020-731_kamil_1.pdf)\* \*viability decreased rapidly if stored higher than 4C. Another [study](https://www.myfoodresearch.com/uploads/8/4/8/5/84855864/_32__fr-2020-078_lestari_1.pdf) using \*L. acidophilus \*and *Bifidobacterium longum* reported similar results whereby cold storage resulted in higher viability compared to room temperature. However, *B. longum* had a more drastic difference in room temperature viability, suggesting that probiotic selection may also be an important factor for gummy viability.

### Food-Matrix Combinations

In addition to packaging, manufacturing, and storage conditions, the [survivability](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/1/455#B66-applsci-12-00455) of probiotics within any format is critically influenced by the strain-food matrix combination (or the other ingredients used in the gummy itself).

For example, the agar/gelatin selection \+ prebiotic ingredients seem to play a role in surviving digestion and storage. The addition of [psyllium husk \+ apple pomace (pectin](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19476337.2018.1433721#d1e339)) to agar or gelatin increased viability, with gelatin as the more preferred texture amongst participants. [Pectin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0740002017308560?via%3Dihub) has previously been shown to improve gastric resistance of *Lactobacillus*, although the difference varies with the species/strains.

Additionally, other ingredients, food components, or chemicals can interact with probiotics and have an impact on their ability to develop and survive. For example, some [research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19419788/) suggests that certain antioxidant polyphenolic plant-compounds may inhibit the growth of lactic acid bacteria.

### Water Content

Lastly, an important consideration for supplements is the [water activity](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6463069/) to prevent unwanted microbial contamination. Due to the chemical properties of gummies, these formats tend to have higher water activity (free water available) than dried formats, such as powders, and this [water content](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20112158/) can impact their stability, texture, shelf life, and microbial growth.

This all in mind, [encapsulating](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8075719/#) probiotics before use in gummy formats or even [juice](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30895197/) formats, could be a more viable option, albeit more costly, to ensure better survival during digestion and storage.

Ultimately, more research and trials are needed to fully assess gummy probiotic survivability in order to better understand the impact of this format on human health, and how it compares to other probiotic delivery systems.

## Measuring a healthy microbiome / Gut testing mythbusting

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

Individuals often want to know what a healthy microbiome looks like. However, this type of question is one that still evades microbiome scientists due to a variety of reasons.

In order to answer your inquiry, we must first discuss some important concepts in the field of microbiome science.

To start, in 2007, the National Institute of Health spearheaded a $173 million [Human Microbiome Project](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2792171/) (HMP) to characterize the human microbiome and determine if changes in microbiome composition could be correlated with health and disease.

The overarching goal of the HMP was to understand the range of genetic and physiological diversity that can exist within a human microbiome **\[OPTIONAL EXTENSION here:** as well as the factors that could affect its distribution and evolution. From there, the data of the HMP could be used to identify new ways to determine microbiome-related disease susceptibility and possible treatment strategies.**\]**

The HMP encompassed five years of research and over 200 scientists. It concluded in 2012, finding that, in fact, *there is no universally healthy microbiome*\! That said, what this study did reveal is that the metabolic function of your microbiome, rather than what microbial species are present there, is of importance (translation: it can be more important *what your bacteria are doing*, rather than ‘who’ they are).

In addition, there are substantial limitations with using microbiome testing kits, especially when detecting the presence of symbiotic organisms. These tests can have high levels of inter-day variability, and take a small subsection of stool that may not be representative of the colonic microbiota.

With this in mind, not only do these tests have apparent constraints based on the sampling methods—but science is also not yet at the point in which we have concretely defined what a ‘healthy’ microbiome looks like (as this can vary based on the individual), so the actionable insights from these tests can be limited.

That said, diagnostic tests are certainly still useful tools for specific endpoints beyond understanding whether one’s microbiome is ‘healthy’, such as in understanding and helping to diagnose bacterial vaginosis, or to understand how the body metabolizes glucose.

So, while we encourage consumers to enjoy participating in citizen science, it is also important to note that there could be limitations with using certain diagnostic tools based on where the science is today. We’d always encourage individuals to garner any specific insights from this testing with a personal physician.

The HMP encompassed five years of research and over 200 scientists. It concluded in 2012, finding that in fact, *there is no universally healthy microbiome*\! However, the HMP did reveal that what’s most important is the metabolic function of your microbiome, rather than what microbial species are present there (translation: it’s much more important what your bacteria are doing, rather than who they are).

To dive deeper, there are a few [reasons](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6825832/) why measuring a healthy microbiome can be challenging—all of which are discussed in great detail in the 2018 [workshop](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6825832/) “Can We Begin to Define a Healthy Gut Microbiome Through Quantifiable Characteristics?”, where 40+ academic, government, and industry experts convened for discussion.

Some relevant conclusions were as follows:

* Mechanistic links of specific changes in gut microbiome structure with markers of human health are not yet established  
* Microbiome communities are highly individualized & show a high degree of inter-individual variation to perturbation  
* Static genetic sampling misses important short- and long-term microbiome-related dynamic changes to host health

In relation to gut tests in particular, there can be substantial limitations with using microbiome testing kits, especially when detecting the presence (measured as relative abundance) of symbiotic organisms.

In fact, numerous studies ([1](https://gut.bmj.com/content/65/3/540), [2](https://gut.bmj.com/content/65/1/57), [3](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-and-infection-microbiology/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2021.639667/full)) have shown that the microbiome composition of your GI tract actually varies significantly from your stool. A snapshot of your stool microbial composition does not accurately tell us what’s happening in the gut, as a small subsection of stool may not be representative of the colonic microbiota.

Additionally, the consistency of stool can determine how readable the sample is–and this is something that can vary widely, even in one person, from day to day.

Lastly, there can also be day to day variation as your GI tract encounters foreign substances including food, medicine, and nutrients. Many of these things can end up in the stool which may impact the results when a small subsection is utilized.

**\[OPTIONAL ADD ON relating to use of personalized probiotics / why probiotics did not show up in gut test:** Further, taking the results from these tests to inform probiotic supplementation regimens can be misleading. This is because probiotics are [transient](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3424311/) microbes (they travel through your intestines to deliver health benefits), and outside of specific cases like a fecal microbiota transplant (FMT), most strains do not colonize the gut. In fact, research shows that probiotics organisms are [no longer recoverable](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3424311/) in stool 1–4 weeks after stopping consumption. Instead, they work by supporting overall gut health through interactions with resident microbes and local cells as they make their way through your GI tract.

As an example, scientifically-studied probiotics (like DS-01® Daily Synbiotic) take a different approach, one that looks at specific strains of beneficial bacteria which have a health benefit in humans *independent* of someone’s starting microbiome; and one that doesn’t intend to replace, replenish, or deplete existing gut microbes in order to work their ‘magic’.

Relating this all back to the fact that we do not yet know what a ‘healthy’ microbiome looks like, it is clear that personalizing probiotic supplementation based on these results is not necessarily evidence-backed based on current research. So, while we wish it were as simple as ‘find out what’s missing and put the good stuff back’, it’s clear that’s unfortunately not how a complex ecosystem like the human body works.**\]**

In summary then, there is currently no way to define how your microbiome “should” be, and the brief snapshot of what’s exiting your gut at the time of sampling simply does not reflect the dynamic ecosystem existing within, nor does it provide evidence-backed, actionable insight. So while we encourage customers to enjoy participating in citizen science, it is also important to note that there could be limitations with using such diagnostic tools based on where the science is today. Thus, it may be best to garner any specific insights from this testing with your physician; and, if necessary, assess whether a probiotic supplement could be beneficial to you based on the specific benefit(s) you may be seeking.

### Version 3 (deepest \+ most scientific)

To dive deeper, here are some [reasons](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6825832/) why measuring a healthy microbiome can be challenging:

1. The microbiome can [exhibit immense diversity and complexity](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-019-0667-z): The human microbiome is incredibly diverse, consisting of trillions of microorganisms—including not only bacteria, but viruses, fungi, and more. This diversity makes it challenging to identify and characterize all the different species present—so much so that still yet, scientists refer to the part of the set of unknown microorganisms occasionally referred to as “microbial dark matter” or “functional unknowns”.  
2. There is a high degree of inter-individual variation: Microbiomes vary significantly from *person to person*. Factors such as genetics, diet, lifestyle, environment, and even birth delivery method can influence the composition of an individual's microbiome.  
3. The microbiome is [highly dynamic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6825832/#sec12title) in nature: The composition of the microbiome is not static; it can change within an individual, *over time,* in response to various factors such as diet, medications, and environmental exposures. This dynamic nature makes it challenging to pinpoint a stable set of microbial characteristics that define a healthy state.  
4. [Certain technological limitations still exist](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.752829/full): While advancements in sequencing technologies have improved our ability to analyze microbial communities, there are still limitations. Some microorganisms are challenging to culture or identify accurately, and certain functions of the microbiome are not fully understood or easily measurable with current techniques.  
5. [Defining function vs. composition](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-021-04216-2): As mentioned, assessing the functional aspects of the microbiome (what it does) is just as important as understanding its composition (what microorganisms are present). However, functional analysis is more complex and less straightforward than identifying microbial species, making it harder to define what a ""healthy"" function entails.  
6. [Lack of Reference Standards:](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6391518/) Unlike some medical parameters where there are clear reference ranges, defining a standard for a healthy microbiome is difficult due to the variability between individuals and populations. What may be considered healthy for one person, may not be the same for another.  
7. The microbiome is [intricately connected](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5050011/) with various aspects of human health, including the immune system, metabolism, and mental health. Understanding the interactions between the microbiome and these systems adds an additional layer of nuance to defining what is considered a healthy microbiome. In fact, health effects of specific microbial signatures might well be context dependent,—i.e., some bacterial taxa may be associated with health in some circumstances, and disease in another. [*Akkermansia*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/akkermansia), for example, is [correlated](https://www.doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2014-308778) with healthier metabolic features in obese individuals and [inversely](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12015) with prevalence of multiple sclerosis. It might therefore be impossible to determine microbiome features that are universally healthy; what constitutes a “healthy microbiome” for one person or human population might well be unhealthy in a different context.

In summary, the challenges in measuring a healthy microbiome arise from its diversity, individual variation, dynamic nature, technological limitations, the need to assess both composition and function, and the lack of clear reference standards. Ongoing research is working to address these challenges and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the microbiome's role in human health.

## How does X disruption \[drinking / processed foods / sugar / sleep / stress\] impact the gut microbiome?

### Alcohol

[Alcohol](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cofs.2020.10.001) has been shown to affect the composition of microbes in the gut, changing the proportions of beneficial and harmful bacteria, which can lead to dysbiosis. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4210345/) suggests that limiting alcohol can change the gut significantly in as little as three weeks.

**\[Sweeteners add-on:**

Beer often contains additives such as high fructose corn syrup, artificial colors and flavors, preservatives, and sweeteners, all of which have been [linked to disruptions](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-019-02161-8) in the gut microbiome. For example, animal studies suggest that high fructose consumption may lead to [increased intestinal permeability](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/ijmm.2018.4040).

Similarly, certain additives and sweeteners [can alter](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-019-02161-8) microbial communities and influence fiber fermentation processes and SCFA production. **\]**

### high-fat foods

[High-fat meals](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916523302600?via%3Dihub) can significantly slow gastric emptying and intestinal transit time, potentially leading to bloating and discomfort.

**\[Saturated fats:**

Saturated fats can be found in animal products and some plant oils, and tend to slow digestion and prolong gastric emptying. This is due to their dense structure, which requires [more time](https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085%2872%2980115-X/fulltext) and effort to break down.

High dietary saturated fat intake is [associated with](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4584183/#:~:text=Effect%20of%20dietary%20fat%20intake,30.045%2C%20p=0.069).) a significant increase in the prevalence of constipation (likely [because](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/1/122#:~:text=Regular%20consumption%20of%20saturated%20fatty%20acids%20\(SFA\),composition%2C%20potentially%20leading%20to%20intestinal%20dysbiosis%20[47].) saturated fats slow intestinal transit time).

Increased consumption of saturated fat [has been shown to](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41074-3) [cause changes](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/1/122#:~:text=Regular%20consumption%20of%20saturated%20fatty%20acids%20\(SFA\),composition%2C%20potentially%20leading%20to%20intestinal%20dysbiosis%20[47].) in gut microbiome composition, decreasing gut microbiota diversity and the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria in humans. **\]**

**\[Trans fats:**

In addition, artificial trans fats—found in processed and fried foods–are more difficult for the body to digest and [metabolize](https://doi.org/10.5650/JOS.62.57), and may [impair](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.669672/full) gut health over time. They can disrupt gut microbiota [composition](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/transfatty-acids-alter-the-gut-microbiota-in-highfatdietinduced-obese-rats/8CD01C19E7B4B6E7F4C1436F4025194B) and contribute to slower transit times and [inflammation](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7231579/). **\]**

### Sugar

Studies suggest that added sugar [promotes an inflammatory profile in the gut](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7284805/) and damages the microbiome. Research has also found that simple sugars can block the production of a key protein that promotes the colonization of beneficial [bacteria](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1813780115) in the gut. In one [study](https://academic.oup.com/femsec/article/94/7/fiy084/4996782) of specialized mice, sucrose metabolism was found to alter the survival capabilities of *Lactobacillus plantarum* in the digestive tract, leading to an increase in potentially pathogenic bacteria.

High sugar intake has also been [associated with](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7284805/) an increase in the relative abundance of Proteobacteria (a phylum known for containing many pathogenic species), and a decrease in the abundance of Bacteroidetes (a phylum associated with maintaining gut health and producing beneficial metabolites).

**\[Impacts beyond the gut:**

Beyond the gut, sugar has an impact on other important functions: high-sugar diets can [impair memory function](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306452215004480?via%3Dihub) and [cognitive flexibility](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/06/150622182034.htm) via the gut-brain axis, and sugar has [been shown](https://www.nature.com/articles/celldisc201720) to increase the risk of autoimmune diseases by damaging the tight junction barrier functions of the gut via alterations in gut microbiota and their metabolites. \]

### OTHER STRESSORS: Stress, sleep

**\[Stress \+ food:**

Interestingly, [evidence](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23954410/) suggests that stress deactivates executive function in response to food cues and elicits a bias toward comfort foods. \]

**\[Lack of sleep:**

Poor sleep patterns have been [shown to](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5909328/) disrupt the gut microbiome. For example, [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6290721/#B38) show that circadian clock misalignment and sleep deprivation change microbial community structure. Interfering with the sleep patterns of mice can also [change](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27912059/) the structure and diversity of the intestinal microbiota. **\]**

### Isolated disruptions \+ gut resiliency

[Studies](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature12820) show that a change in diet can cause detectable [shifts](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature18846) in your microbiota in as little as 24 hours. Once you return to a normal diet, however, your gut microbiome will [revert to its original structure](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature18846) within roughly 48 hours. For “minor” disruptions (such as a day or two of dietary change), the gut microbiome can be fairly resilient, with microbial composition returning to baseline relatively quickly. It tends to be more significant disruptions (like antibiotic use, or longer-term habits) that can lead to substantial alterations in composition and diversity, requiring a longer recovery period.

## Postbiotics

### OPTIONAL ADD ON 1: Background information on probiotics vs. postbiotics

To begin, it would be helpful to start with some context surrounding the definition of probiotics vs. postbiotics.

Probiotics are defined by The International Scientific Association of Probiotics and Prebiotics ([ISAPP](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrgastro.2014.66)) as “live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host.”

In contrast, a [postbiotic](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41575-021-00440-6#Sec4) is defined by ISAPP as a “preparation of inanimate microorganisms and/or their components that confers a health benefit on the host”. It is important to note that though they are inanimate (non-viable), postbiotic organisms are not *inactive*—there is no loss of function.

That said, the term “postbiotic” can be viewed as an umbrella term for [various microbial components](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9027423/) which are essentially by-products of live probiotic bacteria. To elaborate, “postbiotic” refers to substances derived after microorganisms are no longer alive (inanimate/dead/heat-killed); thus, the microbes comprising a postbiotic may be inanimate cells which are still or could even be structural fragments of microbes (i.e., cell walls).

Further, effective postbiotics must contain microbial cells or cell components (e.g. structural fragments of microbes like cell walls), that contribute to observed health benefits. That said, several postbiotic preparations can include microbe-produced substances, such as metabolites, proteins, or peptides—which may all contribute to the overall health effect conferred by a postbiotic.

It’s important to note, a postbiotic must also be derived from well-defined microorganism component(s) where their genomic sequences are known and can be prepared for standardization. Further, the characterization of these genomic sequences must be made before the postbiotic organisms are rendered inanimate—via methods such as heat-killing.

Of note, the **loss of viability** may be the direct correlation between a probiotic and a postbiotic, however, a dead probiotic does not automatically satisfy the definition of a postbiotic. Probiotics may produce ‘postbiotic-like’ metabolites, and in some cases, it may be assumed that they work symbiotically to confer health benefits on the host. It may be [hypothesized](https://app.asana.com/0/1202193115010295/1202219926983859#:~:text=it%20may%20be-,hypothesized,-that%20inanimate%20cells) that inanimate (aka dead) cells—that may or may not satisfy the definition of a postbiotic—present in some probiotic products prior to consumption may participate in the overall health benefit(s) expected for said probiotic product.

Lastly, many commercial products claim they contain postbiotics; however, they fall short of the actual definition. For example, a product which claims a synthetic chemical is a “postbiotic” simply because it helps the downstream production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) isn’t following the actual definition of a postbiotic. Instead, the proposed postbiotic should be derived from microbial origin in order to qualify as a true postbiotic.

### OPTIONAL ADD-ON 2: Expanding on interactions with microbial communities and production of metabolites

In addition to providing specific benefits, such as relief from symptoms or modulating important health-related biomarkers, postbiotic products have been thought to interact with specific microbial communities and alter their structure.

For instance, the consumption of SCFAs (beneficial fermentation products from indigestible fibers) encourages cross-feeding by host-native species, which may result in additional [different](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27259147/) SCFAs.

B-[vitamins](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6593275/) are not only necessary cofactors for human metabolic reactions and often taken in the form of supplemental vitamins, but can also be [produced by certain species](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6615432/) of bacteria which are not always found in the human gut, or are only present in insignificant quantities.

Another postbiotic compound, exopolysaccharides (EPS), may modulate the gut microbial composition and activity within the host. Some EPS polymers can be used as fermentable substrates by commensals, into metabolites which have been shown elsewhere to [provide benefit to the host](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29790546/) and [encourage the growth](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6193118/) of species traditionally thought of as helpful species like *B. longum*, and [*L. acidophilus*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24857877/). To note, however, no human intervention studies have been performed to confirm these effects on the microbial community interactions described in-vitro. The aforementioned postbiotic compounds have typically been studied for their effects *in-vitro,* while adult human intervention studies reporting changes in microbiota in using postbiotics are scarce. That said, one [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963996915302684?via%3Dihub) showed significant increase in propionic acid, butyrate, and valeric acid upon supplementation with a non-viable probiotic, resulting in a significant increase in Clostridium cluster IV.

### OPTION 4 \- Are there any known benefits of postbiotics that aren’t covered by prebiotics and probiotics?:

**\[OPTIONAL ADD-ON 1: Background information on probiotics vs. postbiotics\]**

In general, postbiotics may confer some of the same health benefits as a probiotic. This in mind, current [literature](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7468815/) suggests that the boundary between probiotics and postbiotics is blurred in some trials, as their impact on the host is often not evaluated separately. Further research is warranted to determine the distinctive relationship between probiotics and postbiotics and how they may interact.

That said, all probiotics do not carry ‘postbiotic’ effects and the two \-biotics are classified differently. In addition, a postbiotic is not needed for a probiotic to confer its intended health benefits on its host (and vice versa).

The molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of postbiotics seem to be mediated through an interaction between the host and microbial products, though various other [interactions](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167779915000220) have been proposed. Most notably, it is thought that postbiotics trigger the host immune system, to activate anti-inflammatory responses, which may be beneficial in certain scenarios, or disease states where inflammatory markers may be elevated (e.g., pathogens, or metabolic endotoxemia as a result of poor systemic health/lifestyles).

It is important to note that much of the [research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924224416302412?via%3Dihub) which has been conducted on postbiotics to date has mainly focused on *in vitro* work—thus, mechanisms of action leading to various possible benefits in human subjects have not been fully elucidated. In sum, the combined efforts of various instances of *in vitro* research has proved illustrative and informative as to how postbiotics may act in the human host.

This said, though there is limited data on orally administered postbiotics in humans, some preliminary studies suggest that certain postbiotics may reduce [diarrhea​](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14964345/) and alleviate [symptoms​](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32277872/) associated with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), including abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, or changes in regularity. However, in [one study](https://journals.lww.com/eurojgh/abstract/2013/12000/modulation_of_gut_barrier_function_in_patients.8.aspx) in which individuals with obstructive jaundice were administered both the probiotic (live) and postbiotic (inactivated) versions of *Lactiplantibacillus plantarum* 299v (formerly known as *Lactobacillus plantarum*), no benefits were found with respect to gut barrier function modulation in the group that received treatment with the postbiotic (inactivated *L. plantarum* 299v).

With regards to the effects of postbiotics on different causes of diarrhea and gastrointestinal functioning, studies with postbiotics show positive and safe effects of the postbiotic product, particularly in adults ([1](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?journal=Food+Res.+Int.&title=Effect+of+continuous+ingestion+of+a+beverage+prepared+with+lactobacillus+gasseri+cp2305+inactivated+by+heat+treatment+on+the+regulation+of+intestinal+function&author=D.+Sawada&author=T.+Sugawara&author=Y.+Ishida&author=K.+Aihara&author=Y.+Aoki&volume=79&publication_year=2016&pages=33-39&doi=10.1016/j.foodres.2015.11.032&), [2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22179215/), [3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22179215/)). On the other hand, postbiotic use in children may warrant caution, as [some data](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12548058/) suggests that supplementation may result in adverse gastrointestinal symptoms and diarrhea.

This in mind, postbiotics may be considered as a useful option if the bacterial organism involved has beneficial properties, but might be unsafe if introduced alive—for example, in immunocompromised individuals.

For example, an [in-vitro study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1348-0421.516.x) demonstrated that when viable *Lactobacillus casei* Zhang (LcZ), isolated from koumiss, was administered to a certain kind of macrophage (immune cell) engineered to study inflammatory pathways *in-vitro*, there was an increase in the production of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and interferon (IFN)-β. Interestingly, however, when non-viable, heat-killed LcZ was administered to these same macrophages, there was a significant decrease (or attenuation) of the immunostimulating effects noted with use of viable LcZ.

Finally, postbiotics are often easier to produce than probiotics, since keeping bacteria alive for long periods of time under conditions such as the human GI tract is challenging (without the correct delivery system).

## Oral Probiotics \+ Candida

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been specifically studied regarding its effects on *Candida* overgrowth, so we cannot directly comment on any potential difference in effect. Further, as a dietary supplement, DS-01® is not intended to diagnose, treat, prevent, or cure any condition or disease state. That said, probiotics are generally considered safe for individuals with pre-existing conditions.

For some additional context on the research landscape, you may be interested to know that there is emerging research focusing on probiotics as a potential method of support for *Candida* infection (candidiasis). For example, one [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29380647/) found various strains in the *Lactobacillus* genus exhibited antifungal activity against \*Candida albicans. \*

While [*Lactobacillus* strains](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8757823/) seem promising for combating candidiasis, it is important to note that a majority of studies are *in vitro* (i.e. in a lab) and the mechanisms of action are not well-known. Further, most research focuses on \*Candida albicans, \*so there is less known about [non-*C. albicans*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6946018/) species. Therefore, more rigorous studies and clinical trials in humans are needed to understand how probiotics could potentially support those with *Candida* overgrowth, as well as the strains and dosages needed.

With this in mind, it is important to note that there is currently no blanket recommendation about which probiotic strains are best for *Candida* overgrowth. Thus, if you have any specific questions concerning the safety and utility of a particular health product, it may be pertinent to consult your primary physician who can advise based on your complete health history.

## Cardiovascular Health \+ Probiotics

### General

Many factors are associated with overall cardiovascular health, but growing [evidence](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33671813/) indicates that the intestinal microbiome plays a role through a [variety of mechanisms](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41371-022-00698-6). Thus, the therapeutic potential of probiotics in influencing heart health has received attention in the scientific literature.

## Estrogen / Vaginal Atrophy

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

\[If in regards to VS-01™: Kindly note we have not clinically evaluated VS-01™ Vaginal Synbiotic with respect to impact on any diseases or conditions or in \[perimenopausal / menopausal / postmenopausal\] individuals, and therefore we cannot make any claims related to \[low estrogen / vaginal atrophy\] or \[perimenopause / menopause / postmenopause\]. We ultimately recommend consulting with a physician or gynecologist who can provide personalized guidance on the best plan of care with the knowledge of your full health history and current concerns.

For context, VS-01™ is clinically validated for efficacy, safety, and tolerability, and is the only vaginal synbiotic featuring three proprietary Lactobacillus crispatus strains (LUCA103™, LUCA011™, LUCA009™) selected for superior characteristics. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, VS-01™ restored and maintained an optimal vaginal microbiome 10x more effectively than a leading oral vaginal probiotic, and 100% of participants experienced regulated vaginal pH. Further, 90% of participants with a non-optimal vaginal microbiome established an optimal vaginal microbiome dominated by L. crispatus. If interested, you may find information on our product clinical trial on the [product references page](https://seed.com/reference/vs-wk) of our website.

This mind, I'd be happy to provide some information on the current literature around the vaginal microbiome, estrogen, and vaginal health if it is of use to you. \]

**\[Alt noting VS-01™: VS-01™ supports maintenance, stability, and protection against pH disruptors: by introducing L. crispatus (which is dominant in stable and resilient vaginal microbiomes) and maltose (a glycogen byproduct that L. crispatus uses for food), VS-01™ supports [conversion](https://seed.com/vaginal-synbiotic) to an optimal vaginal microbiome and protects against common pH disruptors.\]**

There is a complex relationship between estrogen and vaginal health: to begin, [estrogen](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5933095/) prompts the epithelial (lining) cells of your vagina to replicate and mature, creating a thicker vaginal wall. These cells are loosely held together, so once they mature, they slough off into the lumen (open space) of the vagina. Of note, these epithelial cells are full of [glycogen](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4024347/) (an energy storage molecule), which human and bacterial enzymes convert into food that lactobacilli bacteria love. Finally, [lactobacilli](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35127550/) create lactic acid—which lowers the pH of the vagina, thereby helping to inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria.

All said: more estrogen leads to more mature vaginal epithelial cells (and a thicker vaginal wall), which leads to more glycogen in the vagina, which leads to more lactobacilli, which leads to a lower pH. Conversely, lower estrogen can lead to a thinner vaginal wall, less lactobacilli, and a higher pH.

That said, most [studies](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.819958/full#B92)​ examining the effects of vaginal probiotics have primarily focused on their impacts on the vaginal microbiome; the few studies that have examined vaginal atrophy in this context have used probiotics in combination with estrogen, rather than alone. Additional research is needed to effectively evaluate the relationship between vaginal probiotics and vaginal atrophy \[in a perimenopausal / menopausal / postmenopausal population\].

## PPI's (Omeprazole, Prilosec, etc.)

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

There are no known contraindications between probiotics and prescription or over-the-counter medications; therefore, taking DS-01® Daily Synbiotic alongside a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), such as **\[medication name\]**, would generally be safe.

In fact, synbiotics—a prebiotic and probiotic combo—have gained much [traction](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59550-x) in the scientific community as a management strategy for microbiome-related side effects of long-term PPI use (i.e., gut permeability, liver enzymes, and quality of life).

That said, we would always suggest consulting with **\[your / the prescribing\]** physician as they can provide personalized guidance based on your full health history and current medications.

### If concerned about DS-01® absorption

Additionally, it may be helpful to dig into the ways DS-01® and \[PPI-medication name\] work (as well as where they work).

To review, \[PPI-medication name\] is a proton pump inhibitor that works in the stomach to reduce acid production.

In contrast, DS-01® is formulated to support multiple markers of digestive health to reinforce a healthy overall gastrointestinal system. For example, [research](https://seed.com/reference/syn-wk) demonstrates strains in DS-01® promote healthy regularity, ease of occasional digestive discomforts, improvement in intestinal environment, and a balanced gut microbiome.

Our registered 2-in-1 capsule delivery technology, ViaCap®, is a proprietary capsule-in-capsule system we developed to safeguard the viability of the probiotic organisms in DS-01® through digestion (i.e. past the stomach), for complete delivery to the colon.

In this 2-in-1 design, the inner capsule (which houses our probiotic formula) is nested within an outer capsule containing the free floating prebiotic powder. This separation of the probiotics from the prebiotics helps ensure shelf stability, and bacterial viability. Further, this outer capsule acts as a barrier to oxygen, moisture, and heat—avoiding the need for refrigeration of DS-01®.

To understand how this delivery technology performs, we've tested this system in the Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem ([SHIME](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK500150/®))--the closest system developed to model digestion and the gut. It is intended to recreate the physiological conditions and biological processes representative of the human gastrointestinal tract. Based on the results of this in vitro testing, the probiotic dose is fully released at the end of the small intestine for complete delivery to the colon.

As probiotics are most effective when they make it to your colon alive, this nested capsule technology is an vital aspect of DS-01®.

### Version 2 (deeper explanation)

There are no known contraindications between probiotics and prescription or over-the-counter medications; therefore, taking DS-01® Daily Synbiotic alongside a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), such as **\[medication name\]**, would generally be safe.

Interestingly, synbiotics—a prebiotic and probiotic combo—have gained much [traction](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59550-x) in the scientific community as a management strategy for microbiome-related side effects of long-term PPI use (i.e., gut permeability, liver enzymes, and quality of life). In fact, a clinical trial also [demonstrated](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35063245/) that probiotic intervention might be a beneficial strategy to suppress PPI-induced microbial perturbations. That said, there may be additional research needed to further explore these effects.

Of course, we would always suggest consulting with **\[your / the prescribing\]** physician as they can provide personalized guidance based on your full health history and current medications.

### Version 3 (deepest \+ most scientific)

There are no known contraindications between probiotics and prescription or over-the-counter medications; therefore, taking DS-01® Daily Synbiotic alongside a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), such as **\[medication name\]**, would generally be safe. We also do not expect PPI use to harm DS-01® strains.

In fact, synbiotics—a prebiotic and probiotic combo—have gained much [traction](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59550-x) in the scientific community as a management strategy for microbiome-related side effects of long-term PPI use (i.e., gut permeability, liver enzymes, and quality of life).

Further, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled [trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35063245/) administering probiotics after repeated PPI use in healthy individuals demonstrated that probiotic intervention inhibited PPI-induced microbial changes. This means that probiotics might be beneficial in suppressing PPI-induced microbial perturbations, though more research is needed.

Ultimately, we would always suggest consulting with **\[your / the prescribing\]** physician as they can provide personalized guidance based on your full health history and current medications.

**\[OPTIONAL ADD ON for PDS-08® / PPI use, specifically: In fact, data suggests that probiotic administration in children taking PPIs may help decrease the rate of [dysbiosis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4315779/)—a hallmark of many gut disorders.\]**

## Mold Illness

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

[Research​](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5834427/) is starting to reveal interactions between gut microbiota and mycotoxins—which may play a role in the development of mycotoxicosis. Interestingly, probiotics have in fact been [explored](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10519232/)​ as a possible therapeutic in managing illnesses associated with mycotoxins (in fact, in the aforementioned review, certain strains of probiotics possess the ability to reduce the level of mycotoxins—in a sense, ""freezing"" their impact by binding and facilitating their elimination from the host).

## Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)

Kindly note that VS-01™ Vaginal Synbiotic is not intended to treat, prevent, or cure any condition or disease state. Further, we have not specifically studied VS-01™ in a population with bacterial vaginosis (BV), and thus, are unable to comment on any difference in effect, utility or safety in this regard. Therefore, we would suggest consulting with your physician who can appropriately advise on the use of this product with knowledge of your complete health history.

Rather, VS-01™ is the first synbiotic clinically proven to restore a healthy vaginal microbiome and sustain regulated vaginal pH, safe for long-term use. Developed from 15+ years of breakthrough research, VS-01™ is the first vaginal synbiotic formulated with three proprietary strains of *L. crispatus* identified from over 600 candidates for their unmatched efficacy in promoting vaginal health. Our first-of-its-kind synbiotic suppository combines these strains with a rich complex of nutrients and molecules to create the ideal environment and energy source for the probiotic strains to thrive—addressing gynecological health at the source to protect and defend against disruption.

That said, as far as the literature landscape is concerned: to begin with some context, the normal vaginal pH value for a woman of reproductive age can range from [3.8 to 5.0](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15838694/). This acidic environment, a result of lactic acid produced by lactobacilli bacteria, provides a [protective effect](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5143676/) in the vagina against bacterial pathogens. Abnormal vaginal pH levels increase the possibility of infection—specifically, BV is [marked by](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6649105/) a vagina with a pH greater than 4.5.

BV is a dysbiotic vaginal state [caused by](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8618584/) an abnormal proliferation of Gram-negative anaerobes, Gram-positive cocci, and aerobic pathogens, including several pathogenic bacteria—including *Gardnerella vaginalis*, the *Mobiluncus* species, *Mycoplasma hominis*, and the *Peptostreptococcus* species—resulting in an imbalance in the vaginal flora with the disappearance of protective lactobacilli, and subsequently, [subclinical inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6831638/) and vaginal disruptions (such as [discharge and odor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK298830/)).

It has been shown in various[\* in vitro\* studies](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ipid/2008/256490/) that some *Lactobacillus* strains have the capacity to disrupt BV, yeast biofilms, and inhibit growth of urogenital pathogens. By welcoming strains associated with stability and supportive of an optimal vaginal state (such as [*L. crispatus*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6831638/)*)*, your vaginal microbiome is more equipped to out-compete pathogenic bacteria while creating a regulated pH and [protective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6831638/) environment against inflammation and dysbiosis. (To offer some background, vaginal microbiomes dominated by *L. crispatus* are [associated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4891990/#:~:text=colonizing%20the%20vagina.-,L.,et%20al.%2C%202009).) with decreased risk of BV, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and sexually transmitted infections, as well as favorable fertility outcomes and reduced risk of adverse pregnancy events such as preterm birth.)

### OPTIONAL: HORMONAL INFLUENCE

One factor to be taken into account are the unique hormonal fluctuations that occur in women daily, monthly, and throughout the lifespan—or uniquely, if a woman decides to undergo therapies such as oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUD), hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Changes in [hormone levels (especially estrogen), vaginal pH, and glycogen content](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0002937888901111) of vaginal epithelial cells may also hinder the ability for protective Lactobacilli species to colonize and protect this ecosystem from invading pathogens.Sexual activity is yet another [factor](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28277350/) which may influence the vaginal microbiota.

That said, the research regarding **oral** probiotic supplementation of certain *Lactobacillus* strains conflicts with *in vitro* data. Interestingly, delivery mechanisms of such protective bacteria matter: [research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41522-022-00295-y) suggests that direct administration of strains to the vagina may achieve optimal impact as compared to oral probiotics (as there is no direct physiological path for microbes to travel from the GI tract/colon to the vagina). One [study](https://brill.com/view/journals/bm/14/2/article-p143_5.xml?Tab%20Menu=article) found both oral and vaginal probiotic capsules containing *L. crispatus* reduced symptoms in BV patients compared to the placebo group; however, vaginal capsules presented more improvement in the amount of discharge, smell, and itching/irritation than oral capsules. Experts [speculate](https://brill.com/view/journals/bm/14/2/article-p143_5.xml?Tab%20Menu=article) that the anti-BV effect of oral probiotic intake may be due to the regulation of an immune response through the gastrointestinal tract by orally ingested probiotics, rather than the killing of BV-inducing pathogens through the vaginal tract. In fact, while yet to be observed in humans, certain [animal model studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5490510/) have observed that **oral** administration of the *Lactobacillus* species *L. rhamnosus* can be more effective than **vaginal** application of *L. rhamnosus* in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.

### ADDITIONAL RESEARCH ON ORAL VS. SUPPOSITORY \- DIFFERENT STRAIN OPTION (OPTIONAL)

In another [study](https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1471-0528.15675), oral probiotic supplementation of *Lactobacillus rhamnosus* GR-1 and *Lactobacillus reuteri* RC-14 each at 2.5 × 109 colony-forming units (CFUs) failed to prevent bacterial vaginosis (BV) in pregnant women.

In contrast, [intravaginal supplementatio](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12513982/)n of probiotic lactobacilli was able to displace a BV-associated pathogen, *G. vaginalis*, beyond detectable limits for 21 days in one study. Mechanistically, certain strains such as *L. rhamnosus* GR-1, when vaginally administered, can [result](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1462-5822.2006.00763.x) in gene expression changes that are associated with antimicrobial and immunological protection from virulent microbial species—such as [*Escherichiia coli*](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/AEM.00159-07) (*E. coli)*.

Further, there has been compelling [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3415820/) to show that some ‘disruptive’ vaginal organisms have a reservoir in the gastrointestinal tract. So, while oral probiotics will not migrate to the vagina but [can impact​](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9366906/) vaginal communities, promising research suggests that because vaginally administered probiotics ensure maximal contact with vaginal epithelial cells (enabling beneficial changes to the vaginal microbiome), direct vaginal administration could be a strategy to help restore a healthy vaginal microbiome and sustain regulated vaginal pH in a way that is safe for use in the long term. With more research still needed, ultimately, the therapeutic effect of probiotics will likely vary with the administration route and dosage of probiotics.

Currently, the most common method to treat BV is [antibiotics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41522-022-00295-y)—most commonly, metronidazole or clindamycin (which kill bacteria—often both pathogenic and protective), despite a high rate of BV recurrence using this mechanism. Recent literature points to the potential benefit of using probiotics as an adjunct therapy to conventional antibiotic therapy for BV: a [meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23250116/) stated that the efficacy of probiotics-assisted antibiotics in treating BV [was better](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23250116/) than that of antibiotics alone. One [trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4489123/) found that the combination of antibiotic treatment (clindamycin \+ metronidazole) with vaginal probiotic capsules (2 Lactobacillus strains) led to improved clearance rates compared to antibiotic treatment alone.

If you’re curious to learn more, check out our [Cultured article](https://seed.com/cultured/category/vaginal-microbiome/), ‘Bacterial Vaginosis: Getting to the Root of the Fickle Infection.’

All said, while I do hope I provided helpful supplementary information on the field of probiotics and BV, as well as some useful information to better explain the use for and limitations of our product, research in the area has just scratched the surface and is still ongoing. In addition, when cross-comparing the literature, it’s important to take note of differences in trial design, probiotic strains used and other ingredients, dosage, and delivery mechanism, as each may contribute to outcome variance across a similar population. We ultimately encourage you to work with your physician to determine your optimal health and wellness protocol.

## Osteoarthritis

### DS-01 and Osteoarthritis

Kindly note, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been specifically studied in individuals living with osteoarthritis, so we are unable to comment on any difference in effect or utility within this population.

For context, DS-01® is formulated to provide support for digestive and systemic health with core benefits across gastrointestinal function, gut barrier integrity, immune health, cardiovascular health, micronutrient synthesis, and dermatological health. DS-01® is not considered or regulated as a therapeutic and is therefore not intended to treat or prevent any condition or disease state.

In general, probiotics are considered safe for use in most individuals. However, we always suggest an informed conversation with a primary care provider who may advise on the addition of DS-01® given your unique health history.

### Probiotics and osteoarthritis

With all of this in mind, I'd be happy to share the current research on probiotics and osteoarthritis with you if it would be useful.

[Osteoarthritis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482326/)​ is a complex condition, influenced by myriad internal and external factors. The [gut microbiome](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11111653/) ​has recently been identified as a possible contributor to the onset and progression osteoarthritis through its impact on [gut barrier integrity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39457494/)​, the immune system and the ""gut-joint axis"".

While several promising preclinical studies been conducted in various animal models to determine if probiotics could be of use in treating or preventing osteoarthritis, only a handful of [randomized, controlled clinical trials](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10754743/)​ have been conducted in humans. Results of these studies have been mixed, though it should be noted that the methods and probiotic strains varied between the trials.

It is also important to note that the impact of probiotics may vary between different types of arthritis. For example, [one recent study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38239838/)​ found that increased dietary live microbe intake was associated with lower incidence of rheumatoid arthritis, but not with osteoarthritis.

With all of this in mind, more rigorous clinical research is needed to determine whether probiotics could be of use in preventing or treating osteoarthritis; and if is, which strains and dosages would be most beneficial.

## Medications which may potentially interact with the prebiotic component (pomegranate) in DS-01®

### CYP3A4 Interactions:

**\[SIDE NOTE FOR SPECIALISTS: CYP3A4 is the main enzyme involved in metabolism of [\~50% of prescribed drugs](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.2c00237) and listing every CYP3A4 interaction here would be too much. You can reference [this list](https://drug-interactions.medicine.iu.edu/MainTable.aspx) as a base for research regarding CYP3A4 metabolism. However, although pomegranate interaction with CYP3A4 has been studied, pomegranate \+ individual drug reactions are not as well-studied\]**

#### List of some medications metabolized by CYP3A4:

* Psychiatric/Neurological Medications  
  * [Escitalopram](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557734/) (Lexapro) \- SSRI  
  * [Carbamazepine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15673597/) (Tegretol) \- anticonvulsant / anti-epileptic drug  
* Immunosuppressants  
  * Tacrolimus (Prograf) \[[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9611668/), [2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23200637/), [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10154516/)\]  
* Cardiovascular Medications  
  * Statins  
  * [Nitrendipine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22275232/) (hypertension/blood pressure drug)

To provide some context, the punicalagins included in DS-01® are a novel, patented, plant-based polyphenol concentrated from the fruit and skin of Indian pomegranate. Each daily dose of the DS-01® delivers 400mg of the polyphenolic bioactives.

Though, not as well studied as grapefruit juice, there is some [literature](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15673597/) to suggest that pomegranate may affect a particular liver enzyme called Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), which aids the body in metabolizing specific drugs and compounds, such as **\[XXX medication\]**. Further, one review shows that [pomegranate juice](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10003857/) *may* affect CYP3A4-mediated drugs.

To elaborate, the inhibitory activity of pomegranate on the CYP3A4 enzyme impacts the metabolism of **\[XXX medication\]**—potentially leading to increased concentration of this medication in your blood.

Of note, one [pharmacokinetic study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10154516/) found punicalagins could bind to CYP3A4, and potentially inhibit its function. While [polyphenol-CYP3A4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4477257/) interactions have been studied, these did not examine pomegranate or punicalagins interactions, specifically. However, these studies were done *in vitro*, either in cells or in animal models. One [review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10003857/) found clinical studies did not observe the same inhibitory effect with pomegranate juice; thus, to better establish [human relevance](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13318-013-0137-x), clinical studies and further research is needed to better understand the impact of pomegranate or punicalagins on CYP3A4 drug interactions.

### STATINS:

Though, not as well studied as grapefruit juice, there may be some potential interactions of pomegranate (mostly in juice form) and certain medications such as statins.

For some background, statins are metabolized by an enzyme called cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). One review shows that [pomegranate juice](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10003857/) *may* affect CYP3A4-mediated drugs. However, one [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25720525/) found that pomegranate juice did not seem to have clinically relevant inhibitory potential on CYP3A4 activity, specifically looking at simvastatin.

However, one [clinical study](https://www.ajconline.org/article/S0002-9149\(06\)01006-X/fulltext) presented a patient who had an adverse reaction while taking a statin and drinking pomegranate juice weekly. Of note, this statin, [rosuvastatin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3303484/) (Crestor), is metabolized by a different, but similar enzyme, CYP2C9.

### CYP2C9 Interactions:

#### BLOOD THINNERS/ANTICOAGULANT:

see: [Blood Thinners/Anticoagulants (Warfarin or DOAC/NOAC)](https://app.getguru.com/card/0bf89e61-d459-4408-b9c4-1e13485af284)

### ACE INHIBITORS:

#### Examples of ace inhibitors

* Benazepril (Lotensin).  
* Captopril.  
* Enalapril (Vasotec).  
* Fosinopril.  
* Lisinopril (Zestril).  
* Moexipril.  
* Perindopril.  
* Quinapril.  
* Ramipril (Altace).  
* Trandolapril.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are used to control high blood pressure by inhibiting the body from producing a substance that narrows blood vessels. Pomegranate has been found to [inhibit ACE](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37384918/#:~:text=Pomegranate%20\(Punica%20granatum%20L.\),constituents%20against%20ACE%20is%20unknown.) and could potentially work as an ACE inhibitor. It may be possible that pomegranate may increase the effect of ACE inhibitor drugs which may make the drug too strong for some individuals.

## Long-COVID / ACE2 Expression

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been evaluated for any effects on long-COVID, or ACE2 expression.

In the most recent literature, researchers tend to [associate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8510562/)​ increased ACE2 expression in the gut with [*decreased*](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0248730) microbial abundance, in addition to its' dysfunction being correlated with the symptoms of long-COVID. In one [study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0248730)​ on germ-free rodents, or mice treated with antibiotics, expression of [ACE​2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10377338/#:~:text=Microvascular%20dysfunction%20in%20long%2DCOVID,even%20after%20the%20infection%20subsides.)​ increased.

In regards to gut dysbiosis as it relates to COVID-19 outcomes—there has been great interest in understanding the epidemiology of COVID-19 in patients with gastrointestinal diseases and disorders, as SARS-CoV-2 is known to infect the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and [GI symptoms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8238098/#:~:text=Many%20patients%20with%20COVID%2D19,fever%2C%20cough%2C%20and%20dyspnea.&text=GI%20symptoms%20are%20wide%20ranging,pain%2C%20diarrhea%2C%20and%20anorexia.) may present among patients with COVID-19. That said, how SARS-CoV-2 may affect ACE2 expression in the colon, and the implications and effects of such, are not known.

## Histamine Producing Strains / Histamine Production

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

For context, there are some strains of *Lactobacillus* probiotics that can suppress intestinal inflammation by producing metabolites that promote the conversion of dietary histidine into histamine. This bacteria-based metabolic activity is an essential aspect of a [healthy immune system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3916579) and certain [strains](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2011.02717.x) within the species *Lactobacillus* *reuteri, Lactobacillus casei* and *Lactobacillus bulgaricus* promote this metabolic conversion. That said, while DS-01® does contain other strains within these species, our formulation does not contain any strains which have been shown to raise histamine levels (as every strain within a species is entirely different).

#### effects of histamine-producing strains \[PROS \+ CONS\]

It is important to note, however, that the science is complicated. While histamine may pose a problem for certain individuals, the production of histamine can be helpful in other individuals and has been [implicated](https://blogs.bcm.edu/2017/12/19/friend-and-foe-histamine-mediates-allergies-and-can-fight-colorectal-cancer/) as the key mechanism by which some probiotic strains are protective. For example, there has been research investigating certain strains of *Lactobacillus* probiotics\*—*for example,* *several strains of* L. reuteri—\*that can release immunomodulatory factors to suppress intestinal inflammation by promoting the conversion of dietary histidine into histamine—which, in this case, will actually have an anti-inflammatory impact by triggering the [inhibition](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22384111/) of downstream inflammatory signaling. These strains have shown promising insight into microbes as therapeutic agents for [acute colitis](https://mbio.asm.org/content/6/6/e01358-15.abstract) and inflammation-associated [colon cancer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002944017303656#bib23).

It is [proposed](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0031951) that this unique ability of histamine to exert both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects depending on the circumstance may be a result of differences in structural modification of histamine based on its origin of production: when specifically produced by a *L. reuteri*,\* *its structural features actually show variance that may contribute to* L. reuteri\*'s anti-inflammatory effects.

Therefore, histamine generated by intestinal microbes may even offer new possibilities and understanding into the role of microbes in mediating inflammation within the gastrointestinal tract. **\]**

#### DAO Enzyme activity

Histamine produced in the digestive tract is naturally degraded by an enzyme called diamine oxidase ([DAO](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/diamine-oxidase)). Some people with MCAS/[histamine intolerance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17490952) do not have enough DAO, and therefore have trouble properly breaking down histamine in their bodies—leading to an accumulation of the amine that can lead to a variety of symptoms.

Knowing this, individuals with an intolerance to histamine can have varying reactions to probiotics such as DS-01®. Therefore, to be prudent, we would encourage consulting your personal physician to assess your degree of histamine intolerance and to advise on the need for avoiding certain strains of probiotics.**\]**

**\[If needed, use in combination with [Can I take DS-01® if I have a histamine intolerance? / Has DS-01® been studied in individuals with a histamine intolerance?](https://app.getguru.com/card/cAonLEoi/Can-I-take-DS01-if-I-have-a-histamine-intolerance-Has-DS01-been-studied-in-individuals-with-a-histamine-intolerance)\].**

## Biofilm

### Version 2 (deeper explanation)

DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied in the context of biofilms or intestinal yeast/bacteria overgrowth specifically; therefore, we cannot comment on any effects in this regard. However, I'd be happy to share some information from scientific literature\!

One potential mechanism that could aid in the reduction of bacterial overgrowth is the use of [antibiotics or biocides](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099\(03\)00833-8/abstract) for their antibacterial activity—however, with the rise of bacterial resistance to antibiotics and biocides, this option may be a greater challenge in the future. Similarly, antimicrobial peptides (naturally occurring small proteins) can also be antimicrobial and potentially have anti-biofilm activity. A [review](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-021-00585-w)​ points out that while promising, the difficulties in synthetically creating these peptides and the lack of efficacy in clinical trials has hindered the use of these peptides. Further, these peptides are not intended to [replace](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31295426/)​ the use of an antibiotic, but perhaps used in conjunction to boost the efficacy.

Further, this [review](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2020.538077/full)​ examines probiotic use in potentially affecting biofilms; however, the mechanisms of probiotics to achieve these effects are not yet well understood. Interestingly, probiotics can create their own [biofilm](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26060272/)​, preventing the ""bad bacteria"" from making their biofilm.

Of note, biofilm formation may be a 'symptom' of an [underlying disease](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1151552/full)​ or condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease or gastritis; therefore, it may be pertinent to consult your primary care physician as they can best advise knowing your full health history.

## Menstrual Cycle \+ Gut Microbiome / Oral Probiotics

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

**\[optional addition if asking about menstrual cycle changes during acclimation\]** First, I'd like to provide some information on what to expect as your body acclimates to DS-01® Daily Synbiotic, including steps you can take to explore potential causes for your symptoms. Next, I can also offer some insight on the science behind menstruation and the microbiome that you may find interesting.

**\[acclimation verbiage as needed [I am feeling \[UNCOMMON acclimation symptom\] is this normal?](https://app.getguru.com/card/TokBo48c/I-am-feeling-UNCOMMON-acclimation-symptom-is-this-normal-) \]**

The gut microbiome is one of the main regulators of estrogen balance, which has led to the identification of the [estrogen-gut microbiome axis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28778332). Under certain circumstances (such as while taking some medications, or immediately following weight-loss surgery), a disruption of the gut microbiome can lead to decreased circulating estrogens. However, probiotics are not known to upset that system (and in fact, can sometimes be included as a part of recommended health regimens following such disruptions).

So while there are many common causes for menstrual cycle changes, based on the existing body of clinical research, it is unlikely that these occurrences would be related to the use of a probiotic.

As you may know, there are two noteworthy hormones involved in the menstrual cycles: estrogen and progesterone​. Understanding how these chemical messengers work can inform the way we look at the interconnection between the microbiome and menstrual cycles.

* As a [quick refresher](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279054/), although every body is different, most menstrual cycles last for about 28 days and are divided into distinct phases: the follicular phase (the first 14 days or so after your period), ovulation, the luteal phase (time between ovulation and your period), and the menstrual phase (aka menses or your period).  
* Estrogen levels rise before the midpoint of your cycle (the follicular phase), drop down briefly during ovulation, rise again during the luteal phase, then sink to their lowest levels during the menstrual phase. This hormone helps the muscles of your GI tract move smoothly and can even modulate pain responses.  
* Progesterone levels peak during the luteal phase. This hormone can affect how the smooth muscles of the GI tract function, sometimes leading to constipation.​

Interestingly, the gut microbiome is one of the main regulators of estrogen balance, which has led to the identification of the [estrogen-gut microbiome axis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28778332). Under certain circumstances (such as while taking some medications, or immediately following weight-loss surgery), a disruption of the gut microbiome can lead to decreased circulating estrogens. However, probiotics are not known to upset that system (and in fact, can sometimes be included as a part of recommended health regimens following such disruptions).

## Menstrual Cycle \+ Vaginal Microbiome / Vaginal Suppository Probiotics

### Efficacy \+ safety on Vaginal Suppository Probiotics with regards to menstruation

One randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4590344/) observed the impact of vaginal probiotics in 376 women, finding successful colonization of the vagina by vaginally administered Lactobacillus strains. This resulted in significantly increased vaginal lactic acid levels and lowered vaginal pH which are indicators of improved vaginal health. No serious adverse effects arose during the clinical trial and there was no difference in symptoms between the probiotic and placebo groups.

Specifically, there was no evidence of breakthrough bleeding during probiotic administration, nor was there any indication of alteration of the menstrual cycle or change in menstrual symptoms compared to the control group. At this time, there are no scientific studies that contradict these findings.

## What is the research showing that probiotics support/benefit the gut? / 'Probiotic Skeptic'

### Condition-related Studies

Several probiotic strains have demonstrated beneficial use in both [clinical settings and healthy individuals](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19490976.2023.2185034#d1e1150) in recent years. In fact, per the [American College of Gastroenterology](https://gi.org/topics/probiotics-for-the-treatment-of-adult-gastrointestinal-disorders/), there are many gastrointestinal conditions in which scientific evidence has observed certain probiotic strains to serve as valuable tools—such as in Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Antibiotic Associated Diarrhea (AAD), Infectious Diarrhea, Ulcerative Colitis (UC), and Pouchitis.

Specifically, in terms of the clinical landscape of populations with digestive challenges, research [suggests](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9116469/) that probiotics may alleviate the frequency and severity of flatulence, support bowel movement regularity, improve stool consistency, and aid a better overall quality of life.

Additionally, during and after antibiotic use is often considered a good time for probiotics, as numerous studies have shown their ability to mitigate GI distress—such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea in [adults](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22570464/) and [children](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004827.pub4/full), and to promote the [resilience](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36382780/) of a healthy gut microbiome following antibiotic therapy.

To note however, as the field stands, it is [inconclusive](https://www.eurekaselect.com/article/105166)​ whether probiotics can be an effective therapeutic or intervention strategy for all conditions under the umbrella of IBD. While there are studies examining probiotics in the context of IBD (or specifically in the clinical subtypes, ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease), the majority of studies have been conducted \*in vitro—\*either in cells or in animal models. This urges the need for clinical trials in humans to better understand the efficacy of probiotics in managing IBD.

For example, although under the umbrella of IBD, Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) do not present the same—and thus, respond differently to the same treatment. One [meta-analysis](https://academic.oup.com/ibdjournal/article/20/1/21/4578819?)​ examining clinical trials using probiotics for UC, pouchitis, and CD patients indicated that while probiotics were beneficial for maintaining remission in UC and pouchitis patients, the same benefit was not seen in CD patients.

Therefore, while probiotics are generally safe as an [adjunct therapy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9952932/)​ in the management of IBD, there is still a need for large samples of high-quality clinical trials to further determine the efficacy and strain-specific utility of probiotic agents in the induction and maintenance of various IBD subtypes.

It is important to draw attention to the fact that benefits for probiotic organisms are strain-specific. This is because benefits are clinically assessed and demonstrated at the strain level; and, due to the significant variance between strains, this data cannot simply be applied beyond the specific strain(s) studied.

This goes to show that more robust scientific studies are necessary to further evaluate the efficacy of specific probiotic *strains* in various health conditions.

**\[If the member mentions DS-01® or refers to our product(s)**: All said, it’s important to note that DS-01® Daily Synbiotic is regulated by the FDA as a dietary supplement, and as such, is not intended to treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition.**\]**

### DS-01®-specific ADD-ons

Zooming into product-specific benefits, we recently completed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial at [Harvard Medical School](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04598295?draw=2&rank=2&term=seed+health+SH) evaluating the impact of DS-01® Daily Synbiotic on the microbiome of individuals with occasional digestive issues. Findings showed that DS-01® promotes growth of beneficial bacteria (*Bifidobacterium* and *Lactobacilli*)—supporting over 400% population growth of health-promoting gut microbes in those with mixed digestive challenges—compared to placebo. Further, DS-01® significantly improved abdominal discomfort and several markers of occasional constipation (BM frequency and stool hardness). Finally, this study showed DS-01® is clinically validated to promote a balanced inflammatory response in individuals with sporadic digestive disturbances.

Notably, administration of DS-01® increased serum (blood) serotonin—a key molecule for digestive motility and sensation—among participants, which suggests a potential mechanism of action for improvement in digestive symptoms.

Additionally, we recently completed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial under [Health Canada](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04171466?draw=2&rank=1&term=seed+health+SH) evaluating the impact of DS-01® on the microbiome of individuals experiencing occasional gut stress. Findings showed that DS-01® significantly improved gut microbiome composition during temporary GI perturbations and enriched beneficial bacteria in the gut compared to placebo.

For more findings from our clinical trials, you may find our published abstracts here: [Napier et al. *Gastroenterology*;166(5)S-1165,](https://eposters.ddw.org/ddw/2024/ddw-2024/413725/brooke.napier.daily.supplementation.with.a.multi-species.synbiotic.28ds-0129.html?f=listing%3D0%2Abrowseby%3D8%2Asortby%3D2%2Alabel%3D27495%20) and Napier et al. [*Gastroenterology*;166(5)S-1164](https://eposters.ddw.org/ddw/2024/ddw-2024/413717/anthony.lembo.a.multi-species.synbiotic.28ds-0129.alleviates.constipation.and.html?f=listing%3D0%2Abrowseby%3D8%2Asortby%3D2%2Alabel%3D27495)

Overall, DS-01® is formulated with 24 select strains which have been shown in clinical and scientific studies to support benefits for gastrointestinal function, gut barrier integrity, cardiovascular health, gut immune function, gut microbial balance, gut metabolite balance, micronutrient synthesis and dermatological health.

In addition to our finished product human clinical trials, our strains have been studied in over 20 pre-clinical (*in vitro*/mechanistic) and clinical (human) studies combined. You may view the studies by each benefit in addition to exploring more of the science behind our product here: [seed.com/reference](http://seed.com/reference).

That all said, although probiotics are promising, there is much scientific evidence needing to be uncovered to warrant strain-specific claims for various health benefits.

This in mind, it may be helpful to identify what benefits matter to you and then search for transparent companies with the evidence and data-generation plans supporting their product claims. In addition, it is imperative to also look for products scientifically shown to withstand the shipping, storage, and digestive environments that can negatively impact the viability of bacteria.

For more information, you can find a helpful summary on choosing a probiotic in our Cultured article, Probiotics 101: [seed.com/cultured/probiotics-101/](http://seed.com/cultured/probiotics-101/)

Ultimately, if you have any questions about whether a probiotic supplement is right for you, it's best to work with a healthcare provider who can advise on product utility based on the unique benefits you desire and with the knowledge of your personal health history.

### Social Version

Specific probiotic strains have shown benefits for both clinical conditions and general gut health. In fact, the American College of Gastroenterology \[1\] suggests certain strains may be helpful in conditions like IBS, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and certain IBD-subtypes.

Importantly, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic is regulated by the FDA as a dietary supplement, and as such, is not intended to treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition. Rather, our Synbiotic was formulated to support multiple markers of digestive health to reinforce a healthy overall gastrointestinal system. For example, research \[2\] demonstrates probiotic strains promote healthy regularity, ease of occasional digestive discomforts, improvement in intestinal environment, and support a balanced gut microbiome.

Additionally, in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating the impact of DS-01® on the microbiome of individuals experiencing occasional gut stress, DS-01® was observed to significantly improve gut microbiome composition during temporary GI perturbations and enriched beneficial bacteria in the gut compared to placebo \[2\].

It’s important to note however, every individual’s body is unique, and, thus, everyone's experience with specific probiotics is unique. In addition, probiotics work at the strain level, so benefits are tied to specific strains.

That all said, although probiotics are promising, there is much scientific evidence needing to be uncovered to warrant strain-specific claims for various health benefits.

This in mind, it may be helpful to identify what benefits matter to you and then search for transparent companies with the evidence and data-generation plans supporting their product claims. In addition, it is imperative to also look for products scientifically shown to withstand the shipping, storage, and digestive environments that can negatively impact the viability of bacteria.

## Magnesium

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

There are no known or studied contraindications between \[DS-01® / PDS-08® Pediatric\] Daily Synbiotic and other supplements; therefore, taking DS-01® alongside magnesium would generally be fine.

That said, some forms of [magnesium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7911806/#) can promote laxation in the body, making it possible for DS-01® capsules to eject too quickly and appear partially intact in the stool. As such, it might be prudent to separate your intake of DS-01® and magnesium, if possible, and consult with your physician, who can advise on the entirety of your supplement routine with your complete health history in mind.

**\[OPTIONAL: If asking about magnesium glycinate specifically:** Magnesium glycinate is generally considered to be more readily absorbed by the body and has [less of a laxative effect](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10448020/)​ than other types of magnesium preparations (unless used in excess). That said, if you'd like to be extra cautious, we suggest separating your magnesium glycinate and DS-01® intake as much as possible—for example, taking DS-01® in the morning and your magnesium in the evening.\]

### Version 2 (deeper explanation)

There are no known or studied contraindications between \[DS-01® / PDS-08® Pediatric\] Daily Synbiotic and other supplements; therefore, taking \[DS-01® / PDS-08®\] alongside magnesium would generally be fine. That said, some forms of [magnesium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7911806/#) can promote laxation in the body, making it possible for DS-01® capsules to eject too quickly and appear partially intact in the stool. As such, it might be prudent to separate your intake of DS-01® and magnesium, if possible.

It may also be helpful to know that concurrent supplementation of probiotics and magnesium chloride [significantly reduced](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9555745/), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in some individuals, which generally indicates lower levels of [systemic inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK441843/#:~:text=Interpretation%20of%20CRP%20levels%3A,smoking%2C%20and%20genetic%20polymorphisms). With this in mind, it may be pertinent to consult with your physician, who can advise on the entirety of your supplement routine with your complete health history in mind.

### Version 3 (deepest \+ most scientific)

There are no known or studied contraindications between \[DS-01® / PDS-08® Pediatric\] Daily Synbiotic and other supplements; therefore, taking \[DS-01® / PDS-08®\] alongside magnesium would generally be fine.

That said, some forms of magnesium (i.e., [magnesium oxide](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7911806/#), [magnesium citrate](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/nursing-and-health-professions/magnesium-glycinate), etc.) can behave like a laxative in the body, making it possible for DS-01® capsules to eject too quickly and appear partially intact in the stool. As such, it might be prudent to separate your intake of DS-01® and magnesium, if possible.

It may also be helpful to know that a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized [clinical trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9555745/) demonstrated that supplementation of magnesium chloride, alongside *Lactobacillus rhamnosus* GG (contained in DS-01®) and *Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis* BB-12®, significantly reduced [C-reactive protein](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK441843/#:~:text=Interpretation%20of%20CRP%20levels%3A,smoking%2C%20and%20genetic%20polymorphisms) (CRP) levels in some individuals. For context, low CRP levels are generally associated with lower levels of systemic inflammation.

**\[OPTIONAL ADD ON to explain the value of Magnesium: Magnesium has also been [long recognized](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0009898199002582?via%3Dihub) for its vital support of various cellular functions and impact on gastrointestinal health. For example, not only may it [possibly assist](https://www.jnmjournal.org/journal/view.html?doi=10.5056/jnm18194) with easing various digestive complaints like constipation, but animal model studies reveal that magnesium supplementation has been shown to [change the composition](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20089787/) of resident microflora and [may reduce](https://academic.oup.com/ibdjournal/article/24/10/2198/4999657) gut mucosal inflammation. Studies such as these indicate the importance of a varied, [nutrient- and mineral-rich diet](https://seed.com/cultured/eating-for-your-gut/), in addition to other factors (including probiotic and prebiotic intake), to support overall gastrointestinal health.\]**

With all of the above in mind, it may be pertinent to consult with your physician, who can advise on the entirety of your supplement routine with your complete health history in mind.

## Hair loss \+ skin microbiome

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

To date, there has been quite a bit of clinical research on probiotics and skin. However, while there is [preliminary data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3547054/) (in animals) studying the role of the microbiome during hair loss, a conclusive understanding is yet to be [determined](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6499469//). For context, human [skin](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21407241/) and [hair](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21757977/) are host to a vast diversity of microorganisms, and the establishment of an equilibrium is crucial for a healthy skin barrier. The skin microbiome has been extensively studied, while less work has covered those in the dermis and hair follicle.

It's important to note, since all systems are interconnected, it is possible that probiotics could support the hair follicle, although there is extremely limited scientific or clinical data in humans to suggest this.

Interestingly, one [recent clinical trial](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/17/2900)​ found that participants with androgenetic alopecia (the most common cause of hair loss) who consumed an oral probiotic experienced less progression of hair loss—and in some cases, thicker and longer hair—as compared to participants who took a placebo. However, many of these effects varied by age, and more human clinical trials are needed to confirm these benefits and determine which strains, dosages, and application systems (oral vs. topical) would best support the prevention or remediation of hair loss.

Lastly, therapies for dermatological and hair regeneration is certainly not a 'one size fits all' solution. We would recommend consulting with a health care provider as well, as they will be able to advise within the context of your personal medical history.

## Boric Acid

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

There are no known contraindications between VS-01™ Vaginal Synbiotic and any medications or supplements, though we encourage double checking with your physician for any questions related to your specific medication regimen.

That said, as [boric acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4518586/)​ is known to affect bacteria, change vaginal acidity, and/or lead to watery discharge, it may be prudent to space VS-01™ from boric acid.

**\[Alt Research:** Interestingly, while boric acid *can* provide [symptom relief](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/boric-acid#:~:text=In%20a%20case%20series%20of,and%20yielded%20clinical%20improvement%20occurred)​ for some vaginal infections, its [broad antimicrobial effects](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21234349/#:~:text=Boric%20acid%20\(BA\)%20has%20broad,in%20complementary%20and%20alternative%20medicine.)​ mean it does not selectively target pathogens. This indiscriminate action could upset the balance of beneficial bacteria (which are important in [supporting](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9366906/) a healthy vaginal microflora—in effect, creating one ""problem"" as it ""solves"" another), and one possible reason why it may be better used judiciously under medical supervision for acute infections, rather than as a long-term vaginal hygiene product. Though, as with most interventions—more research is needed on boric acid's specific impacts on the vaginal microbiota composition and diversity of individuals. \]

Of note, if any of the VS-01™ protocol dates overlap with the boric acid, it may be prudent to adjust the dates or to take boric acid in the morning and VS-01™ before bed.

Lastly, we always defer to the advice of your physician as they can best advise with your full health history and supplement regimen in mind.

## Osteoporosis

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

Research has shown that the gut microbiota [plays a role in](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34502371/)​ bone metabolism and the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. Although targeted bone health-specific probiotic applications do not currently exist, [probiotics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4623939/) may offer the potential for gut microbiome modulation as an intervention for [gut-bone](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29101658) signaling.

For context, the gut microbiome is strongly intertwined with the regulation of [bone structure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5770520/) through its role in calcium absorption. Permeability of the gut lining and the associated inflammatory response is hypothesized to play a main role in this process. In a hormone-deficient mouse model, the common *Lactobacillus rhamnosus* GG strain [was shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27111232) to decrease intestinal permeability and protect against bone loss. Further studies in rats showed prevention of hormone-induced bone loss with administration of [L. helveticus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17356257) or [L. reuteri](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24677054) strains.

However, studies in humans so far have not always been as clear cut: a [2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29926979) study showed that strain L. reuteri 6475 reduced bone loss in older women—but a [2017 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28628374) determined that a multi-strain probiotic provided a significant decrease in bone turnover, yet no improvement in bone density.

Therefore, further research is needed on specific strains (and strain combinations), dosages, and mechanisms of probiotic applications for osteoporosis in humans.

**\[OPTIONAL add-on:** At this time we do not have plans to make a probiotic for this indication specifically. That said, we do have an extensive [pipeline](https://www.seedhealth.com/?banner=Pipeline) of products planned which will come in a variety of delivery systems targeting a variety of microbial sites and systems so please stay tuned for future products to come\!\*\* \]\*\*

## Neovagina / Vaginoplasty / MTF / Transfeminine / Transgender women

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

VS-01™ Vaginal Synbiotic has not been studied in post-op transwomen or those who have non-natal vaginas specifically; therefore, we are unable to comment on any differences in efficacy or suitability in these populations.

However, I'd be happy to address the current state of scientific literature around neovaginal microbiomes. The field has established that the [neovaginal](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-and-infection-microbiology/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2021.769950/full)​ (surgically created through vaginoplasty) microbiome differs from the natal vaginal microbiome. Further, the [method of vaginoplasty](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-020-00804-1)​ also affects the neovaginal microbiome—in one study, participants who underwent penile inversion vaginoplasty had a microbiome closer to an uncircumcised penis or a testosterone-dominant vaginal microbiome, while those who had a sigmoid vaginoplasty had a gut-associated microbial profile.

Importantly, as the [neovagina](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-and-infection-microbiology/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2021.769950/full)​ generally lacks the glycogen-rich epithelial cell composition needed to support *Lactobacillus* growth, there is typically low prevalence and abundance of [*Lactobacilli*](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/trgh.2022.0100)—and is not well-understood where [existing](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep03746) \*Lactobacilli \*originate and how they are sustained.

This all in mind, research into the neovaginal microbiome is still very sparse and requires more rigorous studies. Therefore, we ultimately recommend discussing with your healthcare provider on the utility of VS-01™ in your routine as they can best advise knowing your health history.

### Version 2 (deeper explanation)

VS-01™ Vaginal Synbiotic has not been evaluated in transgender individuals (either receiving gender affirming hormone therapy or having had gender affirming surgery). We therefore cannot comment directly on the safety or suitability of taking VS-01™ in this population, and advise consultation with your physician for an informed discussion.

However, I'd be happy to address the current state of scientific literature around neovaginal microbiomes. To begin, it's important to mention that the trans vaginal microbiome has not yet been adequately [studied​](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35127550/), in either transfeminine neovaginas or in transgender men with vaginas. Generally speaking, the literature has not defined what an optimal vaginal microbiome looks like in either scenario, and more studies are needed to determine the effects of vaginal probiotics on these microbiomes.

That said, the field has established that the [neovaginal](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-and-infection-microbiology/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2021.769950/full)​ (surgically created through vaginoplasty) microbiome differs from the natal vaginal microbiome. Several [small studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35276200/) characterizing the neovaginal microbiome of transgender women following vaginoplasty found it to have higher diversity than the cis vaginal microbiome, with low prevalence and abundance of [*Lactobacilli*](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/trgh.2022.0100). Further, the [method of vaginoplasty](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-020-00804-1)​ also affects the neovaginal microbiome—in one study, participants who underwent penile inversion vaginoplasty had a microbiome closer to an uncircumcised penis or a testosterone-dominant vaginal microbiome, while those who had a sigmoid vaginoplasty had a gut-associated microbial profile.

Interestingly, in one study, Lactobacilli was [detected](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep03746) in participants who had penile inversion vaginoplasty \[2014\], albeit in lower abundance relative to cisgender participants \[2024\]. However, as the [neovagina](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-and-infection-microbiology/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2021.769950/full)​ generally lacks the glycogen-rich epithelial cell composition needed to support *Lactobacillus* growth, it is not well-understood where these lactobacilli originated and how they are sustained.

On this note, though it is often assumed that *Lactobacillus* colonization would be ideal (as in cis vaginas), there is currently no [data](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35127550/) to support this claim; in fact, neovaginal cells produce little to no glycogen (the food source for *Lactobacillus*) even after years of estrogen therapy. Additionally, no studies to our knowledge that have correlated neovaginal microbial community profiles with indicators of health or disease, so it's not yet clear what constitutes a healthy (or unhealthy) neovaginal microbiome. Finally, the field is currently lacking examination of the long-term effects of estrogen therapy on the neovaginal microbiome.

How the neovaginal community is seeded is also unclear. To date, the composition of the neovaginal microbiome is most strongly [correlated](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/26895269.2023.2237014) with the location from which neovaginal tissue is taken (e.g. genitals, colon, skin, etc.). In addition, while some studies have found evidence that the neovagina can acquire microbes from the [rectum](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24239295/) (and therefore from oral probiotics), others have found few microbial similarities between these two sites.

With all of this in mind, we recommend an informed discussion with your physician, as they can advise based on your personal health history. Knowing that this is an understudied and emerging field, you and your physician may find this [article](https://asm.org/articles/2023/june/genital-microbiome-research-for-transgender-popula)​ and this [scientific review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35127550/) ​to be helpful in guiding your discussion.

## Vaginal Estrogen Supplements / Estradiol

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

First, there are no known contraindications between VS-01™ Vaginal Synbiotic and any medications or supplements, though we encourage checking with your physician for any questions related to your specific medication regimen.

However, kindly note that we have not studied VS-01™ for use with estrogen supplements so we cannot comment on the optimal use or timing.

That said, I'd be happy to provide some information on the current scientific literature around estrogen supplementation and the vaginal microbiome.

In one study, the use of [oral hormonal contraceptives](https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/37/7/1525/6584540#364421543)​ did not have a significant impact on the vaginal microbiome. However, another [study](https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/msphere.00593-20)​ found hormonal contraceptives may *temporarily* affect the vaginal microbiome.

Interestingly, a [study](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2024.1302819/full)​ on vaginal estrogen (estriol cream) found women with a *Lactobacilli*\-dominant vaginal microbiome community pre-treatment had a stable microbiota and minimal change to the vaginal pH, while those that were\* \*initially *Lactobacilli*\-deficient mirrored a ""healthy"" community state type post-treatment. However, it's important to note this study was conducted in post-menopausal women with stress incontinence.

Ultimately, we recommend discussing with your physician as they can best advise knowing your medication and complete medical history.

**\[Optional add-on** if relevant\*\*: In addition, we have not examined VS-01™ use in the context of UTIs or yeast infections; thus, we cannot speak to the utility or timing of this product in this regard. If you have any questions related to when to start VS-01™ in the context of medical concern or medication use, follow the standard of care prescribed and introduce VS-01™ as directed by your physician\]\*\*

## Menopause \+ Estrogen-Gut Microbiome Axis

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

Importantly, the physical changes the female body undergoes during menopause can be enormous and challenging, yet menopause remains an incredibly underfunded and understudied area of medical research. Considering the many medical advancements that are helping many to live active lives well past menopause, this is a population that demands care and study.

As hormone production changes, so too does the microbial composition of the vagina, leaving postmenopausal women at a higher risk of vaginal infections such as [vulvovaginal candidiasis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5770522/), [BV,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5770522/) and [UTI](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28364867/). These risks are further exacerbated by antibiotics, currently the treatment-of-choice women suffering from these conditions.

While it may seem counterintuitive, the gut microbiome and vaginal health are also tightly linked through the [estrogen-gut-microbiome axis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9379122/) (sometimes called the “estrobolome”). In this two-way relationship, microbes in the gut can increase sex hormones including estrogen (by recycling them instead of letting them pass out of the body as waste), and higher levels of estrogen can increase gut microbiome diversity.

However, only one study has examined the effects of [digestive probiotics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10653486/)​ on estrogen levels in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, and more clinical research is needed to determine if probiotics could be used to support estrogen levels \[and vaginal wall thickness\] in these or other populations.

This in mind, kindly note that DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied in individuals experiencing perimenopause or vaginal atrophy specifically; therefore, we are unable to comment on any difference in effect or utility within this population.

**\[For focus on VS-01™ / the vaginal microbiome's relationship to estrogen rather than the gut microbiome, use this card: [Estrogen / Vaginal Atrophy](https://app.getguru.com/card/ipRLEnoT/Estrogen-Vaginal-Atrophy) \]**

## Salicylates / Salicylate Intolerance / Pomegranate interactions

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

Kindly note, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied in individuals living with salicylate intolerance, so we therefore are unable to comment on any difference in effect, safety, or utility in this population.

That said, it is relevant to note that DS-01® does contain a novel, plant-based prebiotic called punicalagins, which is concentrated from the fruit and skin of Indian pomegranate. Each daily dose of the DS-01® delivers 400mg of the polyphenolic bioactives.

While not as well-studied as other fruits, pomegranates have been reported to contain salicylates, though the exact amount appears unclear. **\[OPTIONAL ADD ON** For context, one study reported pomegranates had a [low amount](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4019987/) of salicylates (0.7 mg/kg), while another reported a significantly [higher amount](https://www.fedup.com.au/images/stories/Malakarsalicylate2017.pdf) (15.17 mg/kg) \-- a difference which may be due to the extraction method used and / or the analysis method deployed.\]

Though more studies are needed to properly assess the amount of salicylates in pomegranate, research does ultimately indicate that they may be present in pomegranates.

With this in mind, we would recommend speaking with a physician to ensure the appropriateness of DS-01® considering your unique health history.

## Probiotics \+ Liver Health

### NOTE:

Compliance Reminder: if you mention a specific strain that happens to be in DS-01® while discussing a disease state, please also include research on a strain not included in our formulation, to provide a well-rounded/unbiased view on probiotics \+ medical conditions.

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

The field of microbiome sciences as it relates to liver health is an area of interest for many researchers—so much so that the term ‘Gut-Liver-Axis' has emerged. The [Gut-Liver axis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31622696/#:~:text=The%20gut%2Dliver%20axis%20refers,dietary%2C%20genetic%20and%20environmental%20factors.) describes the reciprocal interaction between the microbiome and the liver, mediated by the portal vein which carries metabolites from the gut to the liver, and bile and antibodies from the liver to the intestine. Aside from their interactions with nuclear receptors in metabolic function regulation, bile acids also help to modulate gut microbiota.

Preliminary [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6956030/) indicates that disturbances of the gut microbiota (dysbiosis) can affect the liver, and [probiotic-based therapies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3990183/) are offering encouraging results to potentially support the restoration of healthy liver function. Some [preliminary research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29557414/) demonstrated that certain strains of probiotics could reduce liver fat, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity (a specific liver enzyme), and inflammatory markers in patients with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). Notably, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG was [evaluated](https://journals.lww.com/jpgn/Fulltext/2011/06000/Effects_of_Lactobacillus_rhamnosus_Strain_GG_in.16.aspx) by researchers as a potential management tool for pediatric obesity-related liver disease through decreasing ALT levels (of note, [high ALT](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559278/)​ is mostly associated with liver cell injury).

## Transgender men / transmasculine / FTM / testosterone therapy

### Version 2 (deeper explanation)

First, kindly note that VS-01™ has not been clinically evaluated in transgender individuals (either receiving gender affirming hormone therapy or having had gender affirming surgery). We therefore cannot comment directly on the safety or suitability of taking VS-01™ in this population, and advise consultation with your physician for an informed discussion.

However, I'd be happy to address the current state of scientific literature around neovaginal microbiomes. To begin, it's important to mention that the trans vaginal microbiome has not yet been adequately [studied​](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35127550/), in either transfeminine neovaginas or in transgender men with vaginas. Generally speaking, the literature has not defined what an optimal vaginal microbiome looks like in either scenario, and more studies are needed to determine the effects of vaginal probiotics on these microbiomes.

Even though it's known that testosterone drastically changes the vaginal environment, only one [study](https://depts.washington.edu/tgnbhealthprogram/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Vaginal-microbiome-of-TGM-Dina-2019.pdf)​ to date has characterized the vaginal microbiome of transgender men receiving testosterone. Unlike the *Lactobacillus*\-dominated vaginal microbiomes of cisgender women, this study found the vaginas of trans men had a diverse microbiome distinctly missing *Lactobacillus* (in fact, their vaginal microbiomes most closely resembled that of post-menopausal women, who have lower estrogen levels). Based on this small initial study, a [larger study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36972958/#:~:text=Introduction%3A%20The%20effect%20of%20testosterone,was%20less%20likely%20to%20be)​ is currently underway to characterize transmasculine vaginal microbiomes at various points during gender-affirming hormone therapy to observe any correlations between hormone levels, microbiome, and health markers such as bacterial vaginosis.

**\[Optional add-on if concerned about menstruation: VS-01™ can be taken if you do not menstruate. You can simply start the Reset protocol at any time, and begin Sustain 5-7 days after your Reset is complete.\]**

**\[Optional add in regarding vaginal dryness:** Vaginal dryness is a common side effect of testosterone therapy. Our VS-01™ SMART tablet™ is designed as a moisture-release product, which means your body’s natural lubrication is required for optimal dissolution of VS-01™––dryness may therefore decrease the tablet’s efficacy. If you experience dryness on an ongoing basis, please consider taking VS-01™ alongside a squalene or hyaluronic-based vaginal lubricant, and discuss use with your physician. \]

## Levodopa / Carbidopa (Parkinson Disease Medication)

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

There are not any known contraindications between probiotics and over the counter or prescription medications, such as levodopa/carbidopa. With this in mind, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic would be generally safe to take alongside levodopa/carbidopa, or any other prescription or over-the-counter medications.

**\[OPTIONAL ADD ON In case you're aware of this research: while it has been [documented](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6338741/)​ that the Enterococcus genus, found in some probiotic supplements, may inactivate levodopa, DS-01® does not include strains from this genus. Further, although several Lactobacillus species were found to harbor the gene for the inactivating enzyme, DS-01® does not contain these specific strains. (if needed, include information from [General Strain Specificity Education](https://app.getguru.com/card/i55LKEoT/General-Strain-Specificity-Education)) \]**

Ultimately, we always recommend consulting with a prescribing physician regarding the combined utility of DS-01® and any medications in your routine, so they may advise with the complete knowledge of your health history and the specific medication.

### Version 2 (deeper explanation)

There are not any known contraindications between probiotics and over the counter or prescription medications, such as levodopa/carbidopa. With this in mind, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic would be generally safe to take alongside levodopa/carbidopa, or any other prescription or over-the-counter medications.

For some background, [levodopa (L-DOPA)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6187751/) needs to remain its precursor form to be able to cross the blood-brain barrier. L-DOPA is then converted to dopamine in neurons by an enzyme called aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). Therefore, levodopa is generally paired with an AADC inhibitor, like [carbidopa](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554552/), to prevent premature conversion outside the central nervous system.

While it has been [documented](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6338741/)​ that the Enterococcus genus, found in some probiotic supplements, may inactivate L-DOPA by converting it to dopamine through a bacterial enzyme, tyrosine decarboxylase (TDC)—DS-01® does not include strains from this genus. Interestingly, the carbidopa inclusion made no difference, meaning it could not inhibit the TDC conversion. Although several Lactobacillus species were found to harbor the gene for the inactivating enzyme, DS-01® does not contain these specific strains. (if needed, include information from [General Strain Specificity Education](https://app.getguru.com/card/i55LKEoT/General-Strain-Specificity-Education))

In addition, a [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-45953-z) found *Bifidobacterium*, a commensal and common probiotic genus, was able to convert L-DOPA to a different end-product (DHPLA)—which is an unusable, irreversible end product that limits the bioavailability of L-DOPA. However, *Bifidobacterium* uses a different pathway than TDC (from above), and is a much less efficient process (1-12% in *in vitro* conditions) and *may* not present a significant barrier to levodopa/carbidopa metabolism like TDC.

Ultimately, we always recommend consulting with a prescribing physician regarding the combined utility of DS-01® and any medications in your routine, so they may advise with the complete knowledge of your health history and the specific medication.

## Eating Disorders

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

To start, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied in individuals living with eating disorders specifically; therefore, we are unable to comment on any difference in effect or utility within these populations. In addition, DS-01® is not considered or regulated as a therapeutic and is therefore not intended to treat or prevent any condition or disease state.

For context, DS-01® is formulated to support multiple markers of digestive and systemic health to reinforce a healthy overall gastrointestinal system and provide core benefits to gut barrier integrity, immune health, cardiovascular health, micronutrient synthesis and dermatological health. [Research](https://seed.com/reference/syn-wk) demonstrates strains in DS-01® promote healthy regularity, ease of occasional digestive discomforts, improvement in intestinal environment, and a balanced gut microbiome.

Based on the research available to us today, we know that the gut microbiome is a major [regulator](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-021-01093-y) of feeding and appetitive behaviors, as well as mental health, through diverse pathways and mechanisms (now identified as the ['gut-brain axis'](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6469458/)). To date, there has been quite a bit of growing clinical [research](https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-022-00681-z) on probiotics' effect on feeding and eating disorders, particularly concerning how the gut microbiota may perpetuate disordered eating behaviors, or make weight regain difficult. Some [research](https://www.cell.com/trends/molecular-medicine/fulltext/S1471-4914\(23\)00269-1?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1471491423002691%3Fshowall%3Dtrue)) investigates the relationship between microbiota and the genetics of individuals with eating disorders.

All said, as with any supplement, individual responses to probiotics can and do vary, and therapies for feeding and eating disorders issues are constantly evolving and certainly not a 'one size fits all' solution. As such, it may be pertinent to consult with your personal physician who can advise on your probiotic and supplement routine within the context of your complete medical history.

## Immunosuppressants / Immunocompromised

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

Although there are no known contraindications between probiotics and medications, kindly note that DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied in immunocompromised individuals, so we are unable to comment on any difference in effect or utility within this population.

It is also important to be aware that isolated cases of immunocompromised individuals developing systemic infections as a result of probiotic use have occurred, leading to [unclear guidance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8706842/)​ as to whether or not probiotics are safe for those who are immunocompromised (whether intrinsically or due to medical treatment, such as immunosuppressants).

With all of this in mind, we encourage you to consult with your physician before adding DS-01® to your routine, as they can offer advice based on your unique medical history and medication regimen.

## PCOS

### Version 2 (deeper explanation)

The gut microbiome regulates certain physiologic functions which are compromised in PCOS (i.e. energy homeostasis, glucose metabolism, systemic inflammation)—therefore, some research has focused on the role of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of PCOS.

Further, findings from a [2020 meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32372265/) investigating the role of probiotic/synbiotic formulas in PCOS patients suggests that probiotics/synbiotics may improve metabolism, affect glucose parameters, reduce serum testosterone and decrease systemic inflammation in women with PCOS.

All said, more robust research is needed to better understand the utility of probiotics, including strains and dosages, in the management of PCOS.

## Role of Maltose in correcting VMB dysbiosis

### NOTE:

🚨\*\* IMPORTANT R+C FLAG: Only use this information when it is not asked in the context of VS-01™, and not implied to be asked in the context of VS-01™. \*\*I.e., strictly a curiosity-based vaginal microbiome question that has not stemmed from a product discussion, etc.

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

\*\* \*\*Interestingly, a [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26385347/)​ found the presence of maltose was associated with ""healthy"" status, in contrast to metabolites associated with ""bacterial vaginosis (BV)"" status. In an [animal model](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2020.594065/full)​ (rhesus macque monkeys), maltose gel was able to facilitate *Lactobacillus* growth and shift from BV-related bacteria dominant to *Lactobacillus* dominant.

One study​ found women with BV or vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) had lower concentrations of [alpha-amylase](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9345037/). Intriguingly, Candida (the primary causative agent of yeast infections / VVC) displays [survival defects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9345037/) when unable to catabolize glycogen​.

## What is an 'optimized / healthy vaginal microbiome?' / CSTs

### NOTE:

🚨\*\* IMPORTANT:\*\* This verbiage should only be used if the member is curious about the vaginal microbiome in general and **does not mention VS-01™**\* / is not asking in the context of a product-based conversation.\* If this information is being provided in reference to or alongside questions about our product, workshop with your manager leaning more into [this card](https://app.getguru.com/card/cj5MgEbi/Why-would-someone-need-to-use-VS01-How-do-I-know-if-I-would-benefit-from-VS01) in SciCare Review per our [Cosmetic Category guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17AvLAb6d9-1R4x-8Cr_czfdnJ5vGl5Zg_EEkXCLvwZs/edit).

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

The vaginal microbiome [is an ecosystem](https://seed.com/cultured/vaginal-microbiome-101/)​ which acts as an important defense against genital and urinary tract infections, vaginal infections, infertility, and much more. [Research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41522-022-00295-y) suggests that a healthy vaginal microbiome is one that is most optimized to protect against health states associated with dysbiosis, such as [infertility](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9406911/), increased risk of [infection](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3780402/), and [bacterial vaginosis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6831638/), and other conditions, in addition to everyday disruptors. Additionally, an optimal vaginal microbiome may be associated with minimal vaginal odor, as well as a lack in burning sensations, discomfort, or excessive ‘[milky](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9406911/)’ discharge.

While no two vaginal microbiomes are exactly the same, the Community State Type (CST) is a current grouping system used to help catalog vaginal microbiomes into 5 primary types to better understand and evaluate them. Current literature supports that CST 1 is considered an 'ideal' vaginal microbiome: characterized by minimal microbial diversity and domination of the species Lactobacillus crispatus, CST 1 promotes high levels of lactic acid and a lower pH, which optimizes the vaginal microbiome to keep out harmful organisms such as [gram-negative bacteria](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3780402/)—thereby ensuring other organisms (such as helpful species and strains from the Lactobacillus genera) can thrive and promote overall vaginal health. CST 1 appears to be the most protective to vaginal infections, sexually transmitted infections, and preterm birth. You can read more about the CSTs and the vaginal microbiome itself, [here](https://seed.com/cultured/vaginal-microbiome-101/)​.

With that said, this microbiome composition is not stagnant but rather is considered to be 'fluid', and can be impacted by things such as menstruation, douching, sex, age, and more, with [some](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msphere.00593-20)​ shifts potentially moving it in or out of a state of dysbiosis.

As disruptions to the vaginal microbiome can be common, every day aspects of daily life, supporting an optimal ecosystem can be an important step in enabling a strong defense system against infections and more.

[Steps](https://seed.com/cultured/vaginal-microbiome-101/)​ such as using antibiotics only when needed or using protection during sex can support this. For a deeper dive on these topics and vaginal health in general, you can check out the Vaginal Microbiome section of our [Cultured blog](https://seed.com/cultured/category/vaginal-microbiome/page/2/)​ for more\!

## CKD / Kidney Disease

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

Please note that DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied in individuals living with kidney diseases or conditions; as such, we are unable to comment on any difference in effect or utility within this population.

In general, probiotics would be safe to take in those with preexisting conditions (including kidney disease); however, we would suggest a discussion with your primary care provider before incorporating any new product into your routine as they may best advise with the full knowledge of your health history.

For some background, probiotics do not enter into systemic circulation and are not metabolized by the kidney (unlike some water soluble micronutrients). Probiotics strains are transient microbes, which journey through your digestive system to your colon (where the majority of your microbiome resides) to activate systemic benefits through programmed interactions with your existing bacteria and your body (their host). This in mind, probiotics should not pose an issue for individuals with kidney disease.

**\[ OPTIONAL ADD-ON: You may be interested in a [meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6533949/) of 8 studies which investigated the role of probiotics (mainly those belonging to the *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium* genera) in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and found that positive effects were reported for some renal function markers, as well as decreases in proinflammatory cytokines. Additional long-term studies are needed to further elucidate the possible role of probiotics in the treatment of individuals with CKD.\]**

### Version 3 (deepest \+ most scientific)

**\[If they're asking about dialysis specifically:**

There would be no need to alter the time of day you take DS-01® Daily Synbiotic depending on dialysis treament. Morning, afternoon, or evening—you know your routines and body best, so try to find a time and method that works best for you. The most important thing is consistent daily intake.

We would also not expect dialysis to have any negative impact on the probiotic organisms in DS-01®. For context, unlike micronutrients and minerals, probiotics do not enter into systemic circulation and thus would not be processed by your kidneys. They transiently move throughout your gastrointestinal tract, interacting with local cells, nutrients and resident microbes along the way.

Please feel free to defer to the expertise of your specialist or primary care provider in regards to best timing of supplements while undergoing any treatments.\]

## Blood sugar / diabetes / pre-diabetes

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

Since diabetes mellitus is a multifactorial disorder, the precise mechanism of action for any specific anti-diabetic effects of probiotics have not been fully established.

That said, it is [thought](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22572877/) that alterations in glucose homeostasis are associated with low-grade inflammation promoted by gut microbiota–derived endotoxins. There is a growing body of [literature](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature18646) to support differences in the host gut microbiome of insulin-resistant individuals compared to a healthy counterpart—one [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06466-x) found not only bacteria associations, but also gut microbial metabolite associations in insulin resistance compared to insulin sensitivity. [Research](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11450/) has demonstrated that imbalances in the composition and function of the intestinal bacteria can lead to blood glucose irregularities, thereby increasing the risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

A recent [meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27864537/) of 13 clinical trials suggested that administration of probiotics appears to have a beneficial role in the management of Type 2 diabetes; however, more rigorous clinical studies with larger sample sizes are required to develop strain-specific applications and treatment guidelines.

## Dementia

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

It has been [suggested](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3232439/) that some probiotic strains have the ability to modulate mood and cognition through a rich and complex network of physiological pathways termed the 'gut-brain axis'.

The [mechanisms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5581153/) of communication between the gastrointestinal tract and the nervous system has generated interest in the link between the microbiome and cognitive decline. It is thought that gut microorganisms may play a role in memory consolidation, neurotransmitter production, receptor signaling, and oxidative stress, to name a few.

That said, it’s important to acknowledge that this is a very new field of study. While the literature on the possible mechanisms involved in gut microbiota modulation and the pathophysiology of dementia is expanding, the [research](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/nutrit/nuaa037/5859723?redirectedFrom=fulltext) regarding the use of probiotics and synbiotics to improve cognitive function is still in its infancy—and at this time there is insufficient evidence to support their clinical application for dementia.

## Pouchitis

### Version 3 (deepest \+ most scientific)

Pouchitis is a rather common inflammatory complication after surgical diversion, post-colectomy for IBD—and is actually a spectrum of disease changes whose exact origins are unclear, though bacteria likely play a role. The etiology and pathophysiology of pouchitis are not well [understood](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22021180/), but it likely results from an interaction between a patient who is genetically susceptible and the ileal mucosa exposed to fecal stasis and bacterial overgrowth. The risk of developing pouchitis appears to be greatest during the first [12 months](https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085\(03\)00342-1/fulltext#:~:text=The%20absolute%20risk%20of%20developing,between%2018%25%20and%2037%25.) after an ileostomy closure. Prevention of initial and recurrent pouchitis is currently thought to be [best practice,](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25023187/) and, while understudied, potential strategies involve adequate post-operative care, dietary modification, weight management, and probiotics.

A Cochrane [meta-analysis](https://cbc.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/102011CDSR.pdf) of 15 studies assessed common therapies used for pouchitis—including antibiotics, budesonide enemas (a steroid drug), probiotics, biologic agents that target tumor necrosis factor, glutamine suppositories, butyrate suppositories, bismuth enemas, allopurinol (a purine analogue drug), and tinidazole (an anti-parasitic drug). They concluded that effective treatments may vary between acute pouchitis and chronic pouchitis, and that probiotics may be helpful in the prevention of pouchitis and in treating chronic pouchitis.

It is known that pouchitis [responds favorably](https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565\(13\)00483-7/pdf) to antibiotics in many cases. Given the frequent improvement of pouchitis with antibiotics, it is proposed that a common denominator is a disruption of the normal gut microbiome. For example, gut *Bacteroides* populations [are depressed](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0066934) in the active inflammatory stage of pouchitis, and at the same time, there is an inflammatory increase in *Proteobacteria*. Because the microbiota play an important role in both healthy and inflamed intestinal surgical pouches, it is thought that manipulation of the microbiome may have therapeutic value. Non-inflamed pouches are shown to harbor higher [diversity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20562611?dopt=Abstract) of bacterial species, and have more anaerobic bacteria, than those with inflammation. This difference is significant enough that microbiome composition may be [predictive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26423113?dopt=Abstract) of risk for [pouchitis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27613294) after colectomy.

While conclusive evidence is lacking (and further RCTs are needed), probiotic supplementation could help to increase microbial richness after pouch formation—early studies show their potential in helping to [expand](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18240282) the populations of regulatory immune cells in the intestinal mucosa. Some potential mechanisms by which probiotics and prebiotics could impact pouchitis include modulation of the gut microbiome, production of SCFAs to improve immune status, and [lessening](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128094020000435) problematic gut permeability.

A [2017 review](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/grp/2017/6029075/) of probiotic administration after colectomy showed that a multistrain probiotic (but not a single-strain probiotic) was beneficial in the reduction of total infections, including surgical and nonsurgical site infections. Multiple controlled [studies](https://academic.oup.com/ecco-jcc/article/11/suppl_1/S321/2961421) indicate that probiotics help to prevent the onset of pouchitis following surgery and may specifically be effective in preventing recurrences in patients who have had prior episodes.

The management of acute pouchitis remains largely empiric, and probiotics may have a role in primary and secondary management of pouchitis, although larger well-designed clinical trials with particular strains are necessary to confirm beneficial effects.

Currently, antibiotic therapy is the primary method for initial management of pouchitis. Although a growing number of studies show that other measures for modulating the microbiome, such as probiotic and dietary interventions, may show intermittent benefits. However, at this time, research shows generally inconclusive results on which therapy / medication is most reliable for the general population of patients with pouchitis. As with UC, it is advisable to work with a medical provider to test and observe which measures may be best for each individual’s particular needs.

## Are more probiotics / a higher cell count/CFU/AFU better?

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

For context, benefits for probiotics are assessed at both a strain and dosage level. Our recommended dose of 2 capsules/day with a total of 53.6 billion AFU is based on the dosages used for each strain in their respective clinical trials and scientific studies which demonstrated the conferred benefits.

There are many variables to consider for probiotics: number of strains, number of cells, method of delivery, etc. Each of these factors impacts the specific benefits of the completed product.

This all in mind, and as individual needs are highly variable, it is difficult to state if ""more is better"" in all circumstances. Higher CFU counts do not [necessarily increase benefits](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28008787/) and the *best* dose is the dose that was most efficacious in clinical human studies.

### Version 2 (deeper explanation)

Benefits for probiotics are assessed at both a strain and dosage level. For example, our recommended dose of 2 capsules/day—a total of 53.6 billion AFU—is based on the dosages used for each strain in their respective clinical trials and scientific studies which demonstrated the conferred benefits.

There are many variables to consider for probiotics: number of strains, number of cells, method of delivery, etc. Each of these factors impacts the specific benefits of the completed product.

According to one [review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4045285/)​, it is generally accepted that probiotic products should have a minimum of 10^6 CFU/mL (or gram) and that a total of 10^8 to 10^9 microorganisms should be consumed daily for the probiotic effect to be transferred to the consumer. The NIH [Office of Dietary Supplements](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Probiotics-HealthProfessional)​ states ""many probiotic supplements contain 1 to 10 billion CFU per dose, but some products contain up to 50 billion CFU or more"".

As mentioned above, the dose is highly context-dependent. Another [review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28008787/)​ examined the dose-responses of probiotics in various conditions, noting that there is no dose-response relation in some conditions (such as atopic dermatitis) but there is a dose-response effect in others (such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea). You can see the wide range of CFUs used in different clinical trials in this [systematic review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8472411/)​ of probiotics, which included looking at micronutrient studies in healthy subjects.

This all in mind, and as individual needs are highly variable, it is difficult to state if ""more is better"". The most optimal dose is highly dependent on the strains, the potential effects, and the targeted health conditions. Higher CFU counts do not necessarily increase benefits in every scenario, and the *best* dose is the dose that was most efficacious in clinical human studies.

**\[OPTIONAL—if asking about AFU/CFU: see [What is the difference between CFU and AFU?](https://app.getguru.com/card/ioM8yEkT/What-is-the-difference-between-CFU-and-AFU) for more details**

We use AFUs rather than CFUs for a more precise measurement of viable cells with flow cytometry. For some background, [probiotics](https://isappscience.org/for-scientists/resources/probiotics/)​ are defined as ""live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host"". The key point here is *live*. The viability of probiotic strains is just as important (if not more) than amount of cells in the product as the bacteria need to be viable to confer health benefits.

You can read more in detail about the differences between AFUs and CFUs in this Cultured [article](https://seed.com/cultured/cfu-vs-afu-whats-the-difference-and-which-is-better/)—but in short, CFU by plate counts is one way of detecting live cells but cells can still be viable without the ability to form colonies or replicating. Thus, AFU from flow cytometry is able to better measure the viability of cells as the viability of the strains it utmost important to ensure efficacy. Flow cytometry and plate count enumerations are not the only measurements of viability, but the non-culture based approaches (like flow cytometry) provide a more accurate count. This [review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8829321/) stresses the importance of viability and ​​the limitations of CFUs. **\]**

## Hemorrhoids

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

While the development of hemorrhoids, or piles, is often attributed to strain that is placed on the veins in the anus or rectum, it can also be attributable to different gastrointestinal disorders (such as Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis). Additionally, the microbiome has been [implicated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8416428/) as one possible way to mediate hemorrhoids, by way of facilitating intestinal motility and assisting with constipation.

[Scientific literature](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29135456/) indicates promising results for the use of probiotics in patients with gastrointestinal diseases, such as decreased pain, diarrhea, bloating, gas, and mucus production. The general [mechanisms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213434420300190?casa_token=LZbgfrec_QcAAAAA:xVFqdBStPrFh6Yk77K_RE8mteiTnWOZZMybkQ_UTydnvnYzgEvBWbV5WUgCKx5F0O7eM51MyA9U#bib0010) include improved gut barrier integrity, balanced immune responses, and favorable changes in the levels of a number of metabolites that are associated with lowered levels of mucosal inflammation.

## Helicobacter Pylori

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

[Research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1521691815001675) has indicated that probiotics may help in improving *Helicobacter pylori* infection and its associated symptoms by strengthening immune status and decreasing gut permeability. You may also be interested in this [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:DDAS.0000037794.02040.c2), which looked at the positive effects of 2 strains in reducing stomach inflammation due to *H. pylori* infection. Kindly note that this study was done in mice, not humans. Further, a [review](https://bmcgastroenterol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12876-021-01977-1) synthesized data demonstrating that probiotic strains, in combination with traditional antibiotic therapy, helped to decrease gastrointestinal symptoms of individuals with *H. pylori*, as well as reducing the side effects of antibiotics.

Of note, the evidence for probiotics in the management of *H. pylori* is certainly in its infancy. We would recommend consulting with a primary care provider in regards to therapeutics for *H. Pylori* as they are best suited to advise under the complete knowledge of your personal health history.

**\[if asking about gastritis:** As one of the main causes of chronic gastritis include [*Helicobacter pylori*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6206577/), mitigating *H. pylori* infection could help with reducing incidence of gastritis. One [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20136974/) showed probiotic bacteria were able to stimulate a pathway to lead to anti-inflammatory signals.

[Research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1521691815001675) has indicated that probiotics may help in improving *H. pylori* infection and its associated symptoms by strengthening immune status and decreasing gut permeability.

**\[OPTIONAL if non-H. pylori gastritis:** However, as this field is currently focused on *H. pylori*\-related gastritis, further research and clinical trials are needed to better understand probiotics \+ gastritis in a non-*H. pylori* context. **\]**

## ADHD

### Version 2 (deeper explanation)

You may have heard of the term ""gut-brain-axis"", which describes the bidirectional relationship which exists between the gut microbiome and the central nervous system (CNS), and the pathway thought to be responsible for the link between peripheral intestinal disorders (for example, IBS) and cognitive dysfunction (for example, migraines).

Further exploring the relationship between cognitive functionality and our microbiomes, the gut microbiome has been [noted](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30023407/) as a potential player in the development of several neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopment disorders, such as [ADHD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32918136/). Current findings in this research area point to bacteria composition, gastrointestinal symptoms, and immune dysregulation related to microbiome alterations may all be implicated in such conditions.

While exciting and fast-growing, its important to acknowledge that the majority of research the gut-brain-axis as it pertains to ADHD is associative, and how this translates to the application of probiotics is not yet known. You may be interested in this literature [review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7830868/) that summarizes the current evidence on the role of the gut microbiome in ADHD pathophysiology and its therapeutic implications.

## Iron Deficiency / Anemia (and Vitamin B12 & B9/folate)

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

Kindly note that DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been examined in patients with\*\* \[low iron levels / iron deficiency anemia/ in the context of iron absorption\]\*\* ; thus, we cannot comment on effects in this regard. However, I'm glad to share information about this topic from scientific literature\!

For some background, dietary iron is usually in the non-bioavailable (ferric) form, and needs to be converted to the bioavailable (ferrous) form in order to be used by cells. One possible mechanism for this involves reducing the pH from neutral to acidic to allow for the [natural conversion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448204/)​ from ferric to ferrous form.

[Lactic acid](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16869994/)​ produced by lactic acid bacteria can help with this process through organic reduction of the pH necessary for the ferrous form, or by excreting [molecules](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28317737/) that help with the ferric to ferrous form conversion. Additionally, systemic [inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6949908/) is suspected of contributing to suboptimal iron uptake. Therefore, some you may find in probiotic products have been associated with increasing iron absorption, possibly through various [mechanisms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6949908/) that influence anti-inflammatory responses, enhance iron uptake, or increase ferrous iron bioavailability.

All this in mind, based on scientific literature, probiotic bacteria may be more beneficial than harmful for iron deficiency; however, as mentioned above, more studies and trials are needed to properly establish the dosage, timing, and method of intake to conclusively determine *if* a strain confers beneficial effects—as benefits are strain-specific and dose dependent.

[Lactic acid](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16869994/)​ produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) can help with this process by organically reducing the pH necessary for the ferrous form. Other molecules created by LAB can also help—for example, [*Lactobacillus fermentum*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28317737/)​ has been studied to increase iron bioavailability by excreting a molecule that helps with the ferric to ferrous form conversion.

Additionally, other bacteria have been associated with increasing iron absorption. *Lactobacillus plantarum* 299v was noted to improve iron deficiency when given together with [Vitamin C](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29353864/)​, [with a meal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5728536/)​, or with a rich source of iron like [pearl millet](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5728536/)​. A [systematic review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6949908/)​ noted this strain may be able to increase iron absorption through various mechanisms that influence anti-inflammatory responses, enhancing iron uptake, or increasing ferrous iron bioavailability.

All this in mind, based on scientific literature, probiotic bacteria may be more beneficial than harmful for iron deficiency; however, as mentioned above, more studies and trials are needed to properly establish the dosage, timing, and method of intake to conclusively determine *if* a strain confers beneficial effects—as benefits are strain-specific and dose dependent.

### Version 3 (deepest \+ most scientific)

Kindly note that DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been examined in patients with\*\* \[low iron levels / iron deficiency anemia/ in the context of iron absorption\]\*\* ; thus, we cannot comment on effects in this regard. However, I'm glad to share information about this topic from scientific literature\!

Interestingly, there is [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4594053/)​ suggesting that probiotic bacteria could help with the bioavailability of iron (i.e. how much iron is available in your body). Majority of the research regarding probiotics and iron bioavailability focus on lactic acid bacteria (LAB) such as the *Lactobacillus* species.

For some background, dietary iron is usually in the non-bioavailable (ferric) form, and needs to be converted to the bioavailable (ferrous) form in order to be used by cells. One possible mechanism for this involves reducing the pH from neutral to acidic to allow for the [natural conversion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448204/)​ from ferric to ferrous form.

[Lactic acid](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16869994/)​ produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) can help with this process, organically reducing the pH necessary for the ferrous form. Other molecules created by LAB can also help—for example, [*Lactobacillus fermentum*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28317737/)​ has been studied to increase iron bioavailability by excreting a molecule that helps with the ferric to ferrous form conversion.

Additionally, one particular strain has been used in multiple studies conducted regarding iron-deficiency anemia (IDA). *Lactobacillus plantarum* 299v was noted to improve iron deficiency when given together with [Vitamin C](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29353864/)​, [with a meal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5728536/)​, or with a rich source of iron like [pearl millet](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5728536/)​. A [systematic review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6949908/)​ noted this strain may be able to increase iron absorption through various mechanisms that influence anti-inflammatory responses, enhancing iron uptake, or increasing ferrous iron bioavailability.

However, aside from *L. plantarum* 299v, other probiotic strains have not been thoroughly considered in clinical trials. Even with this strain, more studies and trials are needed to properly establish the dosage, timing, and method of intake to confer beneficial effects. Please note our synbiotic does not contain this specific strain—benefits are strain-specific and dose dependent\!

All this in mind, based on scientific literature, probiotic bacteria may be more beneficial than harmful for iron deficiency; however, as mentioned above, more studies and trials are needed to properly establish the dosage, timing, and method of intake to conclusively determine *if* a strain confers beneficial effects—as benefits are strain-specific and dose dependent.

**\[OPTIONAL—if asked about vitamin B12/B9 \+ iron:**

Vitamin B is essential for our health: it is known that the lack of [Vitamin B](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamin-b12-or-folate-deficiency-anaemia/)​—Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) and B9 (folate) in particular—is associated with anemia. The human body itself cannot produce [B12](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29216732/)​ or [B9,](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27008500/) and needs to get these vitamins from either food or our gut bacteria. Probiotic bacteria, such as those in the *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium* genera, are known to be avid producers of vitamins, especially [B vitamins](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21933312/)​, and therefore, probiotic bacteria that produce these vitamins may help with anemia.

On a related note, the strain *Bifidobacterium adolescenti*s SD-BA5-IT (also known in the literature as *B. adolescentis* DSM 18350), can metabolize B vitamins found in their natural form (think: folate in leafy greens) into a form that is usable by the human host, known as folic acid. In so doing, these strains [may support](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18685499) uptake of this essential micronutrient.

Similarly, another strain—*Limosilactobacillus reuteri* SD-LRE2-IT—has been [shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8431588/) in *in vitro* conditions to produce vitamin B12—a process that cannot be performed by plants or animals independently. However, it is important to note that the results from this study have only been demonstrated in *""test tube""* models to date. However, our proprietary capsule-in-capsule delivery technology, ViaCap®, shows promise of enabling strains to survive throughout GI transit for arrival to the ileum (the area of the intestines where B12 is absorbed).

Of note, further studies will be helpful to assess and validate probiotic impact on vitamin B12 status in humans. \]

## LMNT / Electrolytes

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

To start, there are no known contraindications between DS-01® and other dietary supplements; therefore, DS-01® would generally be considered safe to combine with other supplements, including LMNT's Electrolyte Drink Mix, as well as consume at the same time.

For some context and to possibly address any concerns as it relates to salt/electrolyte intake alongside probiotics, [this study](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24628)​ found that a daily salt intake of 5,500 mg reduced the intestinal survival of Lactobacillus species, of which DS-01® is partially comprised. Additionally, [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8316525/#:~:text=plantarum%20strains%20could%20survive%20at,%25%20salt%20concentrations%2C%20while%20L.)​ found that L. plantarum strains—DS-01® contains two (L. plantarum SD-LP1-IT and SD-LPLDL-UK)—could survive salt concentrations of up to 6 percent.

That said, \[ LMNT: one packet of LMNT's Electrolyte Drink Mix contains [1,000 mg of sodium](https://drinklmnt.com/pages/ingredients#ingredients) \], leaving it well below the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's [recommendation](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/sodium-reduction#:~:text=Too%20much%20sodium%20contributes%20to,people%2014%20years%20and%20older.)​ of 2,300 mg per day (though, of course, your overall daily consumption would be included in that number) as well as the 5,500 mg reported in the study mentioned above.

\[ For LMNT, specifically: Moreover, if you mixed one packet of LMNT's Electrolyte Drink Mix in 16 ounces of water (LMNT's minimum recommended amount), this would come to a 0.21% concentration of sodium, which is also well below the 6% limit for L. plantarum. Therefore, the amount of salt in your electrolyte drink is unlikely to have a deleterious effect on the probiotics in DS-01®, and would generally be considered safe to take concurrently. \]

With all of the above in mind, it is important to note that there is no universal best way to take DS-01®. The most important factor is consistent daily intake, so we encourage you to pursue a method and routine that works best for you as long as it is well-tolerated by your body. If you feel more comfortable spacing out your DS-01® and electrolyte drink intake, you could try leaving a gap of at least two hours or more. For example, you could take your electrolyte drink in the morning (or whenever is best advised by your physician) while taking DS-01® before bed (at least 2-3 hours after dinner).

All said, we would also suggest consulting with your health care provider to determine the best course of action regarding your supplement routine.

## Hidradenitis Suppurativa

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

Kindly note, DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied in individuals living with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) specifically; therefore, we are unable to comment on any difference in effect or utility within this population. Further, DS-01® is not considered or regulated as a therapeutic and is therefore not intended to treat or prevent any condition or disease state.

However, I'd love to share some information from scientific literature regarding HS and the microbiome.

One [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34364884/)​ found patients with HS had altered skin \+ gut microbiomes compared to patients without HS. Due to this [microbiome connection](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8537933/)​, probiotics have been considered as a potential therapy option for HS. One [article](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/ced.14838)​ suggests the use of a probiotic skin application of skin commensal bacteria (*Corynebacterium* spp., *Staphylococcus epidermidis, Cutibacterium acnes*) as a prophylactic approach for pre-lesion HS.

Although probiotics have been studied in other [inflammatory skin diseases](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31386766/)​ (such as Atopic Dermatitis), there is less known about HS and probiotics. Furthermore, most [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9570026/)​ on HS focuses on the skin microbiome—which may lead to development of a topical probiotic. This all in mind, further studies and clinical trials are warranted to better understand the relationship of the gut microbiome \+ HS, in order to develop an oral probiotic for HS treatment.

## Diverticular disease (diverticulosis, diverticulitis)

### Version 1 (summary / most simple)

DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied concerning diverticular disease (which includes diverticulosis, as well as diverticulitis—an inflammation or infection of the abnormal pouches formed in diverticulosis) specifically, so we are unable to comment on any potential differences in effect in this regard. That said, DS-01® is generally considered safe to take among individuals with preexisting medical conditions, including diverticulosis and diverticulitis.

There have been [a few studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27014757/) looking at the efficacy of probiotics in the remission of diverticular abdominal symptoms. That said, the current [consensus](https://journals.lww.com/jcge/fulltext/2016/11001/probiotics_and_diverticular_disease_.15.aspx) is that there is insufficient evidence as to whether probiotics can effectively reduce symptoms related to diverticulosis.

### Version 2 (deeper explanation)

DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied concerning diverticular disease (which includes diverticulosis, as well as diverticulitis—an inflammation or infection of the abnormal pouches formed in diverticulosis) specifically, so we are unable to comment on any potential differences in effect in this regard. That said, DS-01® is generally considered safe to take among individuals with preexisting medical conditions, including diverticulosis and diverticulitis.

Having said this, you may be interested to know that in fact, the gut microbiota does appear to play a role in the condition, as changes in microbiota composition have been observed in patients who go on to develop acute diverticulitis, with [reductions](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ben/cpps/2017/00000018/00000008/art00004) in taxa with anti-inflammatory activity, such as\* \*[*Clostridium cluster* IV](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ben/cpps/2017/00000018/00000008/art00004), *Lactobacillus,* and *Bacteroides*, and [increases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8070761/) in certain other taxa which may increase inflammation.

With this in mind, there have been [a few studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27014757/) looking at the efficacy of probiotics in the remission of diverticular abdominal symptoms. For example, it does [appear](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ben/rrct/2018/00000013/00000002/art00004) that *Lactobacillus* species, in particular, may be beneficial in reducing bloating and abdominal pain associated with the condition. [Researchers](https://www.jgld.ro/jgld/public/public/Supplements/supplement_2019_4_554.pdf) suggest that from a mechanistic standpoint, probiotics may indirectly help slow progression of diverticular disease—by potentially reducing bacterial translocation, competitively inhibiting the overgrowth of pathogenic and proinflammatory bacterial strains, down-regulating inflammatory cytokines, and improving mucosal defenses (enhancing tight junction integrity).

Though the research is encouraging, the [consensus](https://journals.lww.com/jcge/fulltext/2016/11001/probiotics_and_diverticular_disease_.15.aspx) is that there is insufficient evidence as to whether probiotics can effectively reduce symptoms related to diverticulosis, or to prevent diverticulitis attacks as there are no established protocols defining which strain, what dosage and for how long to use them, and this reflects the absence of reliable meta-analyses in this regard.

### Version 3 (deepest \+ most scientific)

DS-01® Daily Synbiotic has not been studied concerning diverticulosis (or diverticulitis—an\*\* inflammation or infection of the abnormal pouches formed in diverticulosis\*\*) specifically, so we are unable to comment on any potential differences in effect in this regard. That said, DS-01® is generally considered safe to take among individuals with preexisting medical conditions, including diverticulosis \[and diverticulitis\].

However, the endogenous gut microbiota does appear to play a role in the condition. Interestingly, changes in microbiota composition have been observed in patients who go on to develop acute diverticulitis, with a reduction of taxa with anti-inflammatory activity, such as\* \*[*Clostridium cluster* IV](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ben/cpps/2017/00000018/00000008/art00004), *Lactobacillus* and *Bacteroides.*

As such, r[esearchers](https://www.jgld.ro/jgld/public/public/Supplements/supplement_2019_4_554.pdf) have discussed the pros and cons regarding evidence of probiotic action in diverticular disease. Recognizing that overgrowth and alteration of gut microbiota can play a role in the development of inflammation related to diverticular disease, there is certainly rationale for administering probiotics with the aim to restore a healthy microenvironment in the colon. Different mechanisms have been discussed, including:

* decreases in bacterial translocation  
* competitive inhibition of pathogenic and proinflammatory bacterial strains overgrowth  
* down-regulation of inflammatory cytokines  
* improvements in mucosal defense, due to enhanced tight junction integrity.

With these lines of evidence in mind, there have been [a few studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27014757/) looking at the efficacy of probiotics in the remission of diverticular abdominal symptoms. For example, it does appear that *Lactobacillus* species, in particular, may prove beneficial in reducing bloating and abdominal pain associated with the condition, though the [consensus](https://journals.lww.com/jcge/fulltext/2016/11001/probiotics_and_diverticular_disease_.15.aspx) is that there is insufficient evidence as to whether probiotics can effectively reduce symptoms related to diverticulosis, or to prevent diverticulitis attacks.

You may consider other approaches to support the health of your gastrointestinal tract with diverticular disease in mind. For example, it is suggested that diverticular disease [may progress](https://www.wjgnet.com/1007-9327/full/v12/i20/3225.htm) in the setting of lower fiber diets. Further, [researchers](https://dx.doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v12.i20.3225) have noticed a correlation between the amount of fiber consumed in the diets of patients with diverticular disease, and the amount and types of microflora present in their gastrointestinal tract. Regardless—with fiber acting as a [prebiotic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6041804/#:~:text=Prebiotic%20dietary%20fibers%20act%20as,are%20universally%20agreed%2Dupon%20prebiotics.) for good gut bacteria—and supporting digestive health in many ways, you may find increasing your daily fiber intake to be beneficial.

Ultimately, your individual physiology and microbial mosaic will also affect how you respond to probiotics, prebiotics, or other supplements. Therefore, it may be prudent to exercise extra caution and consult your primary care provider, who can advise on the intricacies of your probiotic routine with your complete medical history in mind.
