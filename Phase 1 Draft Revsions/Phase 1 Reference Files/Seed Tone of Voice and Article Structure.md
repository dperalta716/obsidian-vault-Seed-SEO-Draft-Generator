# **Seed Blogs: Tone, Voice & Structure Guide**

## **TONE & VOICE**

### **Tone Configuration**

Seed’s tone is a deliberate blend of voice elements. Use this hierarchy to guide tonal balance:

| Tone Element | Level of Presence |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Friendly** | Always |
| **Educational** | Medium depth |
| **Academic** | Light, never dominant |
| **Marketing** | Subtle, never salesy |

Use contractions, second-person voice, and a balance of confidence and humility throughout.

### **Conversational & Approachable**

* Write as a knowledgeable, friendly guide.

* Use "you" and "your" often.

* Contractions are required

  * **Avoid:** “do not,” “are not,” “is not,” will not,” “they are,” “there is,” “they will,” “it is,” “you have,” “you will,” “you would,” “should not,” “you are,” “we are,” “can not”

  * **Use:** “don’t,” “aren’t,” “isn’t,” “won’t,” “they’re,” “there’s,” “they’ll,” “it’s,” “you’ve,” “you’ll,” “you’d,” “shouldn’t,” “you’re,” “we’re,” “can’t” 

* Rhetorical questions: encouraged in moderation for intro or section hooks; use to guide or disarm

* Maintain readability, not academic distance.

* Parentheticals can help convey tone, context, or humor

**Example:** "You finally remember to take your probiotics—only to notice the expiration date passed weeks ago. Do they still work, or are you just swallowing expensive dust?"

### **Empathetic & Reassuring** 

Microbiome topics are often misunderstood, stigmatized, or just... awkward. Acknowledge that with warmth and clarity.

#### `Emotional Modes:`

* **Primary:** Empathetic

  * Normalize confusion, discomfort, or embarrassment.

  * Acknowledge complexity without shame.

* **Secondary:** Reassuring

  * Avoid judgment, superiority, or alarmism.

  * Maintain a calm, credible tone.

#### `Empathy Examples:`

* “You’re not the first to wonder…”

* “We’ve all been there.”

* “Your secret’s safe here.”

* “It’s not your fault the label reads like a microbiology quiz.”

* "Most probiotic labels are heavy on Latin and light on answers. So, not understanding what you’re buying isn’t a *you* problem—it’s an industry problem."

### **Informative Yet Engaging**

* Avoid overly academic language or excessive citations in early paragraphs.

* Explain before you elaborate if necessary

* Use metaphors, analogies, and real-life scenarios to simplify (without dumbing down)

* Use humor and emojis to drive ideas home when needed

* Bridge casual tone with technical content smoothly.

* Name where science is strong, limited, or still evolving.

#### `Examples`

* "Think of probiotics as helpful allies rather than miracle workers—they shouldn't replace any part of your standard prenatal care."  
* “Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. \[Hill 2014\]([https://doi.org/10.1038/nrgastro.2014.66](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrgastro.2014.66)) In other words, if too many of them die off before they make it to your gut, they won't be able to do what they're meant to.”

### **Strategic Use of Humor** 

Humor is welcome—when earned. Use it to lower the stakes, not distract from the science.

#### `Style:`

* Light, self-aware, mildly cheeky, occasionally dry

* Witty

* Relatable—especially around taboo or “gross” topics

* Hypotheticals and rhetorical questions

* No clichés 

* Never flippant, shaming, or distracting

#### `Techniques:`

* **Parentheticals**

  * **Examples:** (yes, really), (your microbiome doesn’t have a comment section), (not kidding), (aka the worst timing ever)

* **Understatements**

  * **Examples:** “Not exactly dinner table talk.” , “A little less glamorous than the ads suggest.” , “Technically true, but not how digestion works.” , “Let’s just say your microbes have opinions about that.” , “It’s... not winning any fragrance awards.”

* **Witty or Wry H3s (without sacrificing SEO)**

  * **Examples:** “What’s In a Strain Name?” , “Let’s Talk About Poop (Briefly)”

* **Micro-Relatable Observations**

  * **Examples:** “You remembered your probiotics—then left them in a hot car.” , “You tried to pronounce *Bifidobacterium* out loud. Brave.” , “The label says ‘10 billion CFU’—and your brain says, ‘cool?’” , “You bought them because your friend swore they ‘changed her life.’”

### **Compliance-Focused**

* Follow FDA/FTC regulations.

  * **Refer to:** What we can and cannot say.txt

* Avoid restricted terms (e.g., “treat,” “cure,” “boost”)

  * **Refer to:** NO-NO WORDS.pdf

* Prioritize and match benefit language from:

  * DS-01 PDP reference file

  * DS-01 Science Reference File

**Examples of compliant language:**

* “Supports healthy gut immune function”

* “Maintains gut barrier integrity”

## **STRUCTURE & FORMATTING**

### **Consistent Article Framework**

1. **Title:** SEO-friendly, clear, benefit-forward

2. **Overview:** 3–5 bullet summary (no citations)

3. **Introduction:** Engaging, keyword-present, no header (no citations)

4. **Body Sections:** H2s \+ optional H3s

5. **The Key Insight:** Strong final summary

6. **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs):** 3–4 H3s with direct answers (Use Title Case)

7. **Citations:** Numbered APA with accurate DOIs

### **SEO-Optimized Introductions**

* Answer the core question early.

* Include the primary keyword naturally.

* Invite deeper reading with hook/transition

#### `Hook/Transition Examples`

Not necessarily to use verbatim, but examples for style. These can also be used for body sections.

| Type | Sample |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Observation-Based** | “Gut health gets a lot of airtime—but the science behind probiotics rarely makes it past the fine print.” |
| **Myth-Busting** | “If you think all probiotics ‘colonize’ your gut forever, you’ve been sold a myth.” |
| **Micro-Specific** | “Meet Bifidobacterium infantis—a mouthful, but one of the most studied strains in infant gut development.” |
| **Confusion Hook** | “Powders, gummies, capsules—probiotics come in more formats than your streaming apps. But which ones actually work?” |

### **Visual Organization** 

* Paragraphs: Max 4 sentences

* H2s for major sections; H3s for subsections

* Use bullet lists for clarity. (Bullets should be Title Case, **bolded**, and followed by a colon:)

* Bold key points, italicize for tone

* Use white space to improve scannability

* Precede standalone links or concluding ideas with emojis

  * 🌱 For product mentions or branded closers

  * 🧠 When learning is mentioned

  * 💡 When “pro tip” or advice is given

  * Other emojis can be used, but ensure context relevance

## **WRITING MECHANICS**

### **Sentence & Paragraph Rules** 

* Mix short and complex sentences for rhythm.

* Sentence fragments \= okay for tone for bullets

* Begin paragraphs with a clear idea

* One main idea per paragraph

* Add smooth transitions and engaging, conversational bridges

### **Metaphors & Analogies** 

Use only if they clarify, not confuse. If one is used for an idea, stay on-theme.

**Approved Examples:**

* “Think of strains like ingredients in a recipe—not all ‘bacteria’ make the same dish.”

* “It’s like calling in a food truck during a kitchen remodel.”

* “Probiotic strains are like job titles—not just names. Two people named Chris might show up, but only one’s trained for the job.”

* “You wouldn’t hire a wedding DJ to fix your roof.”

* “Polyphenols are the kind of dinner guest your microbes actually want to invite back.”

* “They’re more like consultants: they show up, solve something, and move on.”

## **CONTENT STRATEGY**

### **Scientific Communication**

* Use full strain names on first mention, then abbreviate.

* Only significant claims should be cited.

* Simplify language without sacrificing accuracy.

* Flag where research is ongoing.

* Cite strain-specific studies from provided science file if possible.

* Strain nomenclature: Note that “SD-BB536-JP” means the same thing as “BB536”. Use the latter, as instructed by “SEED strains \- Sheet1.pdf”

### **Citation Rules**

* Use inline citations after sentence periods if applicable) in this format: \[Author Year\]([https://doi.org/](https://doi.org/)...)

  * Example: Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. \[Hill 2014\]([https://doi.org/10.1038/nrgastro.2014.66](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrgastro.2014.66))

* Place citations at the end of the sentence (after the period) unless clarity requires mid-sentence placement.

* The final citation list should follow APA format, ordered alphabetically by author last name, each entry including an accurate hyperlink to its DOI.

* Only include citations for **significant scientific claims**—don’t over-cite common knowledge (e.g., “fiber supports digestion” doesn’t need a source unless mechanistically explained).  
* There should be no more than 29 citations.  
* All sources must be academic or scientific.

### **Strain Mentions & Benefits**

* Refer to strains using the PREFERRED naming conventions listed in the “SEED strains.pdf” file.

  * This file indicates the exact formatting to use for each strain name (e.g., italicization, subspecies, etc.)

  * Do not default to species-only or alternate formatting—use only what’s labeled as “Preferred” in that PDF.

* When discussing research, pull benefit claims and study support from the DS-01 Science Reference File.

* Use strain-level specificity for all health-related claims.

  * **Say:** “This strain has been studied for…” **or** “This strain may help with…”

  * **Avoid:** “This strain helps with…”

* Always align benefits with language found in the DS-01 PDP file when applicable (e.g., “Supports healthy gut immune function”).

* Cite studies appropriately using inline citations after the end of the sentence in the format: “(sentence). \[Author Year\]([https://doi.org/](https://doi.org/)...)”

### **Closers**

Keep the tone clear, grounded, and quietly memorable. Use up to 3 per article at the end of any section (where it makes sense.)

#### `Branded Closers`

Play on words related to Seed or their blog, cultured. Use 1 per article, ideally at the end of The Key Insight section.

**Examples:**

* “In a market full of promises, clarity is rare. Choose what’s seeded in science.”

* “Good gut decisions aren’t made on guesswork. They’re cultured with care.”

* “Because in the end, a well-seeded gut speaks for itself.”

* “This isn’t about flooding your system. It’s about culturing it with care.”

* “Big change starts small. Consider this your seed.”

* “Good health isn’t hacked—it’s cultured.”

* “Now that you’re seeded with science, what will you cultivate next?”

* “Turns out, being cultured never went out of style.”

#### `Other Closers`

**Examples:**

* “Your microbes aren’t guessing. You shouldn’t have to either.”

* “Choose a product that respects the science—and your biology.”

* “You’re growing your gut IQ already. Keep going.”

* “Strain-level precision isn’t a detail. It’s the difference between assumption and outcome.”

* “All probiotics are not created equal—and the science makes that clear.”

* “The goal isn’t to add microbes. It’s to introduce the right ones, at the right time, for the right task.”

* “Turns out, ‘gut feeling’ has a scientific explanation.”

* “Precision probiotics don’t guess. And neither should you.”

* “Strain-specific means function-specific. And that’s where results begin.”

* “Some bacteria show up. The right ones show up with a purpose.”

* “Gut health isn’t a trend. But bad advice about it definitely is.”

* “Consider it a microbial mic drop.”

* “Not bad for a few billion bacteria, huh?”

* “A little growth goes a long way—especially when it starts in your microbiome.”

* “Let that ferment for a bit.”

* “File this one under: stuff your gut will thank you for.”
